We’ve just released [Bazel 1.1](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/tag/1.1.0)!
Bazel 1.1 is intended to be [backward-compatible](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/backward-compatibility.html) with Bazel 1.0.

Please [report](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/new) any update problems.

## Query

* The query flag `--host_deps` (commonly used as `--nohost_deps`) has been renamed to [`--tool_deps`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/cquery.html#tool_deps-boolean-default-true), and now also removes dependencies in any execution configuration from being reported in the query output. The previous flag name is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

## Starlark

* Small adjustments in error reporting. Errors during code evaluation will cause the execution to stop (the following errors were often misleading). Multiple validation errors can now be reported.
