Weâ€™ve just released [Bazel 1.1](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/tag/1.1.0)!
Bazel 1.1 is intended to be [backward-compatible](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/backward-compatibility.html) with Bazel 1.0.

Please [report](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/new) any update problems.

## Query

* The query flag `--host_deps` (commonly used as `--nohost_deps`) has been renamed to `--tool_deps`, and now also removes dependencies in any execution configuration from being reported in the query output. The previous flag name is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

## Starlark

* Small adjustments in error reporting. Errors during code evaluation will cause the execution to stop (the following errors were often misleading). Multiple validation errors can now be reported.

## Documentation

* Improve runfiles documentation.

* Improve documentation on rule outputs.

This release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Andrew Suffield, Austin Schuh, Bor Kae Hwang, Brian Richardson, Christy Norman, Clint Harrison, Dan Halperin, Dave Lee, David Neil, David Ostrovsky, George Gensure, Greg, Jacob Parker, Jakub Bujny, John Millikin, Keith Smiley, marcohu, Marwan Tammam, Mostyn Bramley-Moore, Stepan Koltsov, Thi Don, Thi, Tomasz Strejczek.
