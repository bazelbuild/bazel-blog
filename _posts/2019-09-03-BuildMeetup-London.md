On 1st and 2nd of October 2019, Cloudflare, Bloomberg and Google will be hosting
a Build Meetup at the Cloudflare offices in London.

The event will be themed around all things build and test. Weâ€™ll have developers
and enthusiasts of Bazel, BuildStream, BuildXL, Dune, Pants and others on site.
A special area of interest are Cloud Build Systems (aka Remote Execution).

On day one a series of talks will be presented:

 * Build Systems a la carte - Andrey Mokhov (Jane Street)
 * Dune: the Build System for Ocaml - Jeremie Dimino (Jane Street)
 * Microsoft Remote Execution Internal Alpha Release - Erik Mavrinac (Microsoft)
 * Observing process lifetime and filesystem accesses reliably on macOS - Kristijan Simic (Microsoft)
 * One minute Presubmits - Eric Burnett (Google, RBE)
 * Platforms & Toolchains - Gregory Estren (Google, Bazel)
 * Buildstream - Benjamin Schubert (Bloomberg) & Tristan Maat (Codethink)
 * Buildbox world - Jeremiah Bonney (Bloomberg) & Santiago Gil (Codethink)

On day two there will be plenty of time for collaboration, discussion and hacking.

The event will be attended by many Bazel developers. This is a great opportunity
to chat and mingle with the people behind Bazel. If you'd like to attend the event
