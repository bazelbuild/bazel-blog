The Bazel team is happy to announce the release of [version 0.11.0](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/tag/0.11.0).

## Notable Changes

* [android_binary](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/android.html#android_binary) targets built with ProGuard can now enjoy the [benefits of incremental dexing](https://blog.bazel.build/2018/02/28/incremental-dexing.html) by specifying the attribute `incremental_dexing = 1`.
* [aar_import](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/android.html#aar_import) rules now [support importing assets](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/4439) from the `assets/` subdirectory of the AAR being imported.
* Remote caching [now supports HTTP Basic Authentication](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/cf3f81aef7c32019d70cbce218a64a03276268f0).
* You can now depend on `@bazel_tools//tools/runfiles:java-runfiles` to get a platform-independent runfiles library for Java. See JavaDoc of [Runfiles.java](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/src/tools/runfiles/java/com/google/devtools/build/runfiles/Runfiles.java) for usage information.

## Community Updates

Here are some updates on what happened in the Bazel community over the past month.

### Languages & Rules

*   You can use Bazel to build Rust with [rules_rust](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_rust) for the Rust compiler toolchain and [cargo_raze](https://github.com/google/cargo-raze) to resolve Cargo.toml dependencies into WORKSPACE rules. See [cargo\_raze\_crater](https://github.com/acmcarther/cargo-raze-crater) for an
example.
*   Marcel Hlopko published [the C++ rules roadmap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K3Dq1JDDWjGtvTyFcIwy_-Crm7ZuD9FzSxjDawDhJRA/edit#heading=h.feujy6f2j7mi), which is open for comments.
*   Jay Conrod [published a roadmap](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/blob/master/roadmap.rst) for the Go rules and Gazelle. If you are interested in contributing or have a question, head over to the [bazel-go-discuss](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bazel-go-discuss) mailing list.
*   VSCO released the [latest version of their C++ CROSSTOOL](https://github.com/vsco/bazel-toolchains) using Chromium's LLVM toolchain.
*   The Android build process involves many moving parts and can be complex.  Alex Steinberg wrote here a detailed walkthrough on [How Android Builds Work in Bazel](https://blog.bazel.build/2018/02/14/how-android-builds-work-in-bazel.html).

### Tools

*   Justine Tunney made an experiment about [turning a Bazel BUILD file into a Makefile](https://gist.github.com/jart/082b1078a065b79949508bbe1b7d8ef0) using the results of [bazel query](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/query-how-to.html).

### Community

*   Nick Santos wrote a blog post on whether you should adopt Bazel for Go projects: [Bazel is the Worst Build System, Except for All the Others](https://medium.com/windmill-engineering/bazel-is-the-worst-build-system-except-for-all-the-others-b369396a9e26)
*   Filip Nikolovski wrote an article about how InPlayer is [Managing a Go monorepo with Bazel](https://filipnikolovski.com/managing-go-monorepo-with-bazel/).
*   Alex Eagle of the Angular core team did [a 2-hour long deep dive of Angular's Buildtools Convergence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9Q_2N9oaG8) (ABC).
*   Kyle Cordes also [gave a demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmaE6z_ECRg) on building Angular applications with Bazel at Angular Lunch.
