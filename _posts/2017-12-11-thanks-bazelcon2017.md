title: Thank you for BazelCon 2017
---

We are truly thankful to our community for making our first annual [Bazel Conference](https://sites.google.com/corp/bazel.build/conference2017) a success! Check out all the videos of all the talks from [**BazelCon 2017 on YouTube**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxNYxgaZ8RseY0KmkXQSt0StE71E7yizG).

Your feedback reflected high level of satisfaction, and there was something of interest for everyone:

* Bazel usage and migration stories from TensorFlow, Kubernetes, SpaceX, Pinterest, Wix, Stripe, DataBricks, and Dropbox.
* Talks about upcoming features and tools such as [remote execution & caching](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-buildfarm), [buildozer](https://github.com/bazelbuild/buildtools/tree/master/buildozer), robolectric tests, [PodToBUILD](https://github.com/pinterest/PodToBUILD), [bazeltfc](https://github.com/Asana/bazeltsc), [rules_typescript](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_typescript) presented by Uber, Two Sigma, Google, Pinterest, and Asana.
* Office hours where you got your Bazel questions answered, met engineers, and debugged on the fly. One attendee used their session to configure remote execution with [buildfarm](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-buildfarm)!

BazelCon2017 by the Numbers:

* 200+ attendees
* 60 organizations
* 30 speakers
* 12 informative talks
* 14 hours of hands-on debugging and Q&A during Office Hours

What we heard from you:

* Bazel Query is great!
* Python is used more widely than we realized, and needs better Bazel support.
* Reproducible builds are important especially when you're flying rockets, building autonomous vehicles, delivering media, and calculating financial transactions, leading to wider Bazel adoption by these communities.
* Documentation is often hard to find, and is either too basic or too advanced.
* Bazel's parallelism is impressive: much faster than Maven.
* IDE integration is important, particularly with Visual Studio, CLion, XCode.
* Build Event Protocol enables many options for internal visualization of events.
* Aspects are a powerful tool. 

What we can do next:

* Work on better documentation and training, particularly for intermediate-level topics.
* Prioritize IDE integration.
* Engage the community in building better Python support in Bazel.
* Implement improved support for third-party dependencies.
* Continue work on cross-platform improvements.
* Engage the community in wider adoption and contribution to Bazel.

What you can do next:

* Contribute to Bazel, particularly to the new community driven [buildfarm](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-buildfarm) effort.
* Kick off local meet-ups (we will reach out to volunteers who responded to this in our survey).
* Get more info on Bazel at [bazel.build](https://bazel.build/).
* Join the discussion on bazel-discuss@googlegroups.com.

We look forward to working with you and growing our Bazel user community in 2018!
