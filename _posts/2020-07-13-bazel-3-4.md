[Bazel 3.4](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/tag/3.4.0) has just been released.

Bazel 3.4 is a minor release. It is an incremental update to Bazel 3.3.

## Incompatible changes
* **Removed `--process_wrapper_extra_flags`**. This flag, which was introduced
  primarily to roll out a bug fix, inadvertently exposed the process-wrapper's
  command-line interface to the public. This change is treated as a bug instead
  of backwards compatibility breakage because the flag existed for one release,
  lacked documentation, and solved an edge case, so it shouldn't be widely used.
* **Upgraded `java_tools`** (to
  [version 9.0](https://github.com/bazelbuild/java_tools/releases/tag/javac11_v9.0))
  including a major Error Prone upgrade (to
  [version 2.4.0](https://github.com/google/error-prone/releases/tag/v2.4.0)).
  This includes new checks and new diagnostics for existing checks. As a result,
  you may see new compiler warnings or failures with this release
  ([example fix](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-buildfarm/pull/442/files)).
* **Removed `@bazel_tools//third_party/py/gflags`**. This package is not used by
  Bazel nor any of its tools. Users should import gflags into their workspace,
  or switch to
  [python argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) or\
  [absl.flags](https://abseil.io/docs/python/guides/flags).

## Starlark
* Added  `--starlark_cpu_profile=<file>` flag. This flag writes a profile in
  pprof format containing a statistical summary of CPU usage by all Starlark
  execution during the bazel command. Use it to identify slow Starlark functions
  in loading and analysis. (Mac OS X and Linux only.)
* Removed `--debug_depset_flag`. Depset depth limits are always on and enforced
  at construction.
# Fix behavior of
  [`ctx.actions.write`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/lib/actions.html#write)
  to write content without an incorrect encoding to UTF-8. See
  [#10174](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/10174) for details.

## Rules
* Authors of rules that use toolchain resolution should use the
  `--incompatible_use_toolchain_transition` rule attribute to migrate to using
  the toolchain transition. See
  [#11584](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/11584)
  for directions on migration.
* `apple_binary` rule now accepts the `stamp` attribute with the same semantics
  that it has in `cc_binary` rules. See
  [`apple_binary`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/3.4.0/be/objective-c.html#apple_binary.stamp)
  documentation.
* `--incompatible_objc_provider_remove_compile_info` turns off the compile
  info/`merge_zip` Starlark APIs in ObjcProvider. See
  [#11359](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/11359).
* Add flag `--incompatible_force_strict_header_check_from_starlark` to prevent
  use of legacy header checking mode. See
  [#11679](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/11679).
* Dependencies of `sh_library` targets are correctly included in runfiles.
  Coverage for `sh_library` is configured the same as for `sh_binary` and
  `sh_test`.
* Add flag `--incompatible_blacklisted_protos_requires_proto_info` to make
  ProtoInfo a required provider for `proto_lang_toolchain.blacklisted_protos`. See
  [#11694](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/11694).
* Add flag `--incompatible_linkopts_to_linklibs` which switches around the order
  of flags in `unix_cc_configure`, making `linkopts` appear after `linklibs`.
  See [#10905](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/10905).
* Add flag `--incompatible_require_linker_input_cc_api`. The Starlark API
  changes for creating `linking_contexts` and now `libraries_to_link` must be
  wrapped around a different the class `linker_input`. See
  [#10860](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/10860).

## Other changes
* `bazel info`: Allow to specify multiple keys, for example
  `bazel info output_base server_pid`.
* Support code coverage with GCC 9.
