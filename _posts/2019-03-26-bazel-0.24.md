Bazel 0.24.0 has arrived with an exciting mix of new features, important bug fixes, and updated documentation.

This version of Bazel has been regression-tested against [over 50 open-source projects](https://buildkite.com/bazel/bazel-at-head-plus-downstream/builds/867). Want to get your open-source project on Bazel's CI to ensure that we catch any regressions or have suggestions what we should test against? Reach out to bazel-dev@googlegroups.com and we can set you up!

# Incompatible changes
The following incompatible flags are now enabled by default, and will be removed in a near-term release. Before updating to Bazel 0.24, you may first check if your codebase is compatible either by running [`bazelisk --migrate`](https://github.com/philwo/bazelisk) or by building your code with Bazel
0.23 and the following flags:

   - [`--incompatible_disable_runtimes_filegroups`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6942)
   - [`--incompatible_linkopts_in_user_link_flags`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6826)
   - [`--incompatible_dont_emit_static_libgcc`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6825)
   - [`--incompatible_disallow_filetype`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/5831)
   - [`--incompatible_disallow_dict_plus`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6461)
   - [`--incompatible_disallow_old_style_args_add`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/5822)
   - [`--incompatible_java_coverage`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7425)

The following new incompatible flags have been added in this release. Projects are expected to begin migration:
   - [`--incompatible_list_based_execution_strategy_selection`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7480): Migration to a new style of specifying  execution strategy selection and fallback behavior.
   - [`--incompatible_windows_style_arg_escaping`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7454): Enables correct subprocess argument escaping on Windows. (No-op on other platforms.)
   - [`--incompatible_windows_escape_jvm_flags`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7486): Enables correct `java_binary.jvm_flags` and `java_test.jvm_flags` tokenization and escaping on Windows. (No-op on other platforms.)
   - [`--incompatible_disable_objc_library_resources`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7594): Disables resource attributes in `objc_library`. Please migrate these attributes to `data` instead.
   - [`--incompatible_disallow_native_in_build_file`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7513): Enable migration while removing the use of the `native` module in BUILD files.
   - [`--incompatible_use_toolchain_providers_in_java_common`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7186): Cause `java_common` APIs to require `JavaToolchainInfo` and `JavaRuntimeInfo` providers instead of configured targets.

[`--incompatible_py3_is_default`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7359): Makes targets build for Python 3 unless otherwise specified.

[`--incompatible_py2_outputs_are_suffixed`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7593): Makes Python 3 targets’ outputs appear under the `bazel-bin` directory, and Python 2 targets’ outputs appear elsewhere.

# Starlark
  - The [`actions.args()`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/lib/Args.html) object is now chainable. Its methods now return the object itself.
  - Rules can now safely declare attributes named "licenses".

# C++
  - The `is_using_fission` crosstool variable is now exposed in all compile actions when fission is active (it used to be exposed only for linking actions).
  - [`--incompatible_disable_legacy_crosstool_fields`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6861) will be flipped on the next release. It removes legacy fields from CROSSTOOL files. This flag was around for a few releases, and in 0.24 all the known corner cases have been fixed.
  - [`--incompatible_disable_crosstool_file`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7320) will be flipped on the next release. It disables loading data from CROSSTOOL files, and only uses Starlark to configure C++ toolchains.
  - [`--incompatible_remove_cpu_and_compiler_attributes_from_cc_toolchain`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7075) will be flipped on the next release. These attributes are unused, but cpu attribute was mandatory. This change removes them.
  - [`--incompatible_dont_enable_host_nonhost_crosstool_features`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7407) will be flipped on the next release. With it flipped, "host" and "nonhost" crosstool features are never automatically enabled by Bazel.

# Android
  - Added support for the "navigation" resource directory to Android resource processing in Bazel. This is used by the [Navigation Architecture Component](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/navigation).
  - Fixed issue where exceptions and stacktraces were silently swallowed in the Android resource processing pipeline. See [#7442](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7442).

# Apple
  - Added bitcode support for Apple platforms
  - Added support for differentiating between Xcode betas

# Python
  - Two new incompatible flags have been added to enable switching the default Python version to PY3: one to [make targets build for PY3](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7359) when not otherwise indicated, and one to help ensure that the outputs of these targets are [reachable from the `bazel-bin`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7593) directory. It is recommended to enable both flags together. (But note that until [#4815](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/4815) is fixed, a [workaround](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/4815#issuecomment-460777113) is needed to make Python targets launch with the correct version of the interpreter.)
  - It is now possible to write Starlark rules that depend on or imitate [`py_runtime`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/python.html#py_runtime), by using the new [`PyRuntimeInfo`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/lib/PyRuntimeInfo.html) provider.
  - The [`py_runtime`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/python.html#py_runtime) rule’s [`files`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/python.html#py_runtime.files) attribute is no longer mandatory. It also gains a [`python_version`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/python.html#py_runtime.python_version) attribute for specifying whether it represents a Python 2 or 3 interpreter. This new attribute will become mandatory once Python rules are updated to use the toolchain mechanism.

# Other changes
  - We significantly reduced Bazel’s binary size, it’s now ~95MB on all platforms. We plan to reduce it even further in future releases.
  - The  `//tools/cmd_line_differ` script has been renamed to `//tools/aquery_differ`. The script can now compare, in addition to command lines, inputs of actions given two aquery results.
  - aquery can now query against the current state of Skyframe with `--skyframe_state`.
  - When using the flag [`--incompatible_list_based_execution_strategy_selection`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7480), Bazel now uses remote execution by default if you specify `--remote_executor`. Otherwise, it falls back to either persistent workers, sandboxed local execution, or and at last unsandboxed local execution, assuming the action/platform support those. The flags `--spawn_strategy` and `--strategy` continue to work as before; this only sets new defaults for the case where you don't specify these flags.
