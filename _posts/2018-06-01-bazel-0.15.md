The Bazel team is happy to announce a new version of Bazel, [Bazel 0.15](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/tag/0.15.0)!

On a related note, we'll be organizing the 2018 Bazel User Conference in NYC, on October 9-10. If you would like to join us, please register at: https://goo.gl/forms/1ySgfiKXzntp6Knj2. Check out last year's session recordings on the [BazelCon website](https://sites.google.com/corp/bazel.build/conference2017/bazelcon2017/session-videos).

Here are the main changes of Bazel 0.15:

## C++

*   C++ libraries can access data dependencies (runfiles). See [usage info](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/tools/cpp/runfiles/runfiles.h).
*   C++ artifacts use correct extensions on Windows (`.obj`, `.lib`, and `.dll`).

## Android

*   Added support for including select Java 8 APIs into Android apps targeting pre-Nougat Android devices with `--experimental_desugar_java8_libs`.
*   Added support for pseudo-locales `en_XA` and `ar_XB` with `--android_aapt=aapt2`.
*   Added support for [building fonts as resources](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/look-and-feel/fonts-in-xml).
*   The native Android rules are being incrementally migrated to Skylark implementations in [rules_android](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android).

## Apple

*   Added the [`--apple_enable_auto_dsym_dbg`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/command-line-reference.html#flag--apple_enable_auto_dsym_dbg) flag.
*   The `non_propagated_deps` attribute has been removed from `objc_library` and `apple_binary`.

## Java

*   The `java_plugin.data` attribute has been removed.

## Miscellaneous changes

*   Bazel now always runs binaries in with `bazel run` in interactive mode. The `--nodirect_run` command line option is now a no-op.
*   The `bazel run --noas_test` flag is no longer supported.
*   Bazel now allows [almost all 7-bit ASCII characters](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/c4f2d80270f1ce947fcf7fb0a4e5f0afb3a7062d) in labels.
*   Indentation on the first line of a file [was previously ignored](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/17f8d4e5a36f5c4bd020ce9163f5b1db62679e2c). Bazel now displays an error when it encounters such indentation.
*   The `--incompatible_disable_glob_tracking` flag has been removed.
*   [SkyQuery](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/query.html#sky-query)'s [rbuildfiles](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/query.html#rbuildfiles) now returns targets corresponding to broken packages.
*   Introduce build support for providing cache prefetch hints.
*   The [`--batch`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/command-line-reference.html#flag--batch) flag has been deprecated. For build isolation, we recommend using the [`--nokeep_state_after_build`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/command-line-reference.html#flag--keep_state_after_build) flag instead. This flag guarantees that no incremental in-memory state is kept between builds. In order to keep restarting the Bazel server and jvm at every build, please explicitly use the `bazel shutdown` command.
*   The `--experimental_remote_spawn_cache` flag is now enabled by default. Remote caching no longer requires the `--*_strategy=remote` flags and fails if they are specified.
*   If the `--incompatible_no_support_tools_in_action_inputs` flag is enabled, Skylark action inputs are no longer scanned for tools. Move any such inputs to the newly introduced 'tools' attribute.

## Community

*   Tony Allevato has published [rules_swift](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_swift) which can be used to build Swift libraries and executables for Apple platforms (iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS) and Linux.
*   The code formatter for bzl files is now ready: check out [Buildifier](https://github.com/bazelbuild/buildtools/). Please report any issue you have.
*   Daniel Muller wrote the article [Cross language API schemas with Bazel](https://blog.nrwl.io/cross-language-api-schemas-with-bazel-eff0f498ce0d).
*   Francois Stephany wrote the article about [using Bazel to build polyglot mobile apps](https://tulipemoutarde.be/posts/bazel-for-mobile-apps-part-1/ ) (iOS/Android).
