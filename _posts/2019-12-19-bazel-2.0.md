A new major version of Bazel,
[Bazel 2.0](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/tag/2.0.0) has just
been released. In particular, it brings some important flag flips that did
not make it into
[Bazel 1.0](https://blog.bazel.build/2019/10/10/bazel-1.0.html).

## Incompatible changes
Bazel 2.0 is a new major release and brings the following incompatible changes.

* [`--incompatible_remap_main_repo`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7130)
  is enabled by default. Both ways of addressing the main repository (by its
  name and by '@') are now considered referring to the same repository.

* [`--incompatible_disallow_dict_lookup_unhashable_keys`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/9184)
  is enabled by default.

* [`--incompatible_remove_native_maven_jar`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6799)
  is now enabled by default and the flag removed.

* [`--incompatible_prohibit_aapt1`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/10000)
  is enabled by default.

## Aquery

* Proto v2 for aquery proto output formats, which reduces the output size
  compared to v1, guarded behind the flag
  [`--incompatible_proto_output_v2`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/10358).
  This proto format is still experimental and subject to further changes.

## Platforms

* New incompatible flag, [`--incompatible_remove_enabled_toolchain_types`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/10262),
  which allows removing the `PlatformConfiguration.enabled_toolchain_types`
  field.

## Other important changes

* Package loading now consistently fails if package loading had a glob
  evaluation that encountered a symlink cycle or symlink infinite
  expansion. Previously, such package loading with such glob evaluations would
  fail only in some cases.


* The `--disk_cache` flag can now also be used together with the gRPC remote
  cache.

* An action's discover inputs runtime metrics is now categorized as parse time
  on the CriticalPathComponent.

* Bazel's Debian package and the binary installer now include an improved
  wrapper that understands `<WORKSPACE>/.bazelversion` files and the
  `$USE_BAZEL_VERSION` environment variable. This is similar to [what Bazelisk
  offers](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk#how-does-bazelisk-know-which-bazel-version-to-run-and-where-to-get-it-from),
  except that it works offline and integrates with apt-get.

* We are planning to deprecate the runfiles manifest files, which aren't safe in
  the presence of whitespace, and also unnecessarily require local CPU when
  remote execution is used. This release adds
  `--experimental_skip_runfiles_manifests` to disable the generation of the
  input manifests (rule.manifest files) in most cases. This can be used for
  initial testing, but the exact semantics are still subject to change; let us
  know if this is causing problems. Note that this flag has no effect on Windows
  by default or if `--experimental_enable_runfiles` is explicitly set to false.
