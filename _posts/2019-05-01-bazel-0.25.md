Bazel 0.25.0 has arrived with an exciting mix of new features, important bug fixes, and updated documentation.

This version of Bazel has been regression-tested against [over 50 open-source projects](https://buildkite.com/bazel/bazel-at-head-plus-downstream/builds/939). Want to get your open-source project on Bazel's CI to ensure that we catch any regressions or have suggestions what we should test against? Reach out to [bazel-dev@googlegroups.com](mailto:bazel-discuss@googlegroups.com) and we can set you up!

## Incompatible changes

The following incompatible flags are now enabled by default, and will be removed in a near-term release. Before updating to Bazel 0.25, you may first check if your codebase is compatible either by running [`bazelisk --migrate`](https://github.com/philwo/bazelisk) or by building your code with Bazel

## Android

 - Android NDK C++ toolchain is now configured in Starlark.
 
 - Fixed an issue where the Android resource processor did not surface errors from aapt2 compile and link actions.


## Other Changes

 - Bazel is now ~20MiB smaller, from unbundling the Android rules' runtime dependencies.

 - genrules now support a `$(RULEDIR)` variable that resolves to the directory where the outputs of the rule are stored.
 
 - genquery somepath output is now deterministic.
 
 - Tree artifacts are now deterministic.
 
 - The analysis cache is no longer dropped when the same --define flag is set multiple times and the last value is the same (e.g. if the current invocation was run with "--define foo=bar" and the previous one was run with "--define foo=baz --define foo=bar").
