## Announcements

### BazelCon 2024

BazelCon is right around the corner!

First of all, thank you to all who registered - we are very happy to see the community excited for the conference. The attendance list is now full, with a waitlist open - if you have registered but cannot attend in person, please remember to unregister! Instructions are available [here](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/bazelcon/register/).

The [BazelCon 2024 schedule](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/bazelcon/program/schedule/) is jam packed with lightning and tech talks, Birds of a Feather sessions, and more exciting presentations for all levels of knowledge - from beginners to Bazel professionals. 
Although this year we are not providing live streaming of the event, we plan to upload recordings of the talks to the Linux Foundation YouTube channel. Weâ€™ll share the link to the playlist on the community channels as soon as theyâ€™re available.

### Transfer of community maintained repositories to _bazel-contrib_

The Google Bazel team is migrating community-maintained repositories from the _bazelbuild_ GitHub organization to the _bazel-contrib_ organization. This move aims to provide better maintenance and support for these projects. The _bazel-contrib_ organization is governed by the Bazel Rules Author SIG and supported by the community, ensuring the continued development and health of these valuable resources. Take a look at this [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/orgs/bazelbuild/discussions/2) for more details.
