[Bazel 3.5](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/tag/3.5.0) has just been released.

Bazel 3.5 is a minor release. It is an incremental update to Bazel 3.4.

## Incompatible changes

- Remove the `--experimental_process_wrapper_wait_fix` flag.
- Remove the `--experimental_ui_deduplicate` flag.
- Remove the `--experimental_transparent_compression` flag.
- Remove the `--experimental_action_args` flag.
- Remove the `--incompatible_symlinked_sandbox_expands_tree_artifacts_in_runfiles_tree` flag.
- Bazel now correctly prefers Xcode versions in `/Applications` over
  Other paths, by default.  This resolves an issue with accidentally
  picking up an Xcode version from a Time Machine backup or network
  disk.  If you rely on the old behavior, move your desired Xcode
  version to `/Applications`.

## Rules

### C++
- Add [`cc_common.compile`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/3.5.0/skylark/lib/cc_common.html#compile) support for `include_prefix` / `strip_include_prefix`.

### Android
- Support signing key rotation in `android_binary`.

### Apple
- [`--apple_bitcode`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/3.5.0/command-line-reference.html#flag--apple_bitcode)
  now takes an optional platform and only applies the Bitcode mode to
  that platform if present. The option may be provided multiple times.
- Add optional `oso_prefix_is_pwd` feature for Apple builds.
- `NS_BLOCK_ASSERTIONS` is now passed for all Apple architectures.

### Java
- Java 14 is now supported through custom `toolchain_jdk_14`. The `java_tools`
  repository provides this support in the [java_tools with javac14 v1.0](
  https://github.com/bazelbuild/java_tools/releases/tag/javac14_v1.0) release.

## Other changes

- `cquery` now follows aspects when the [`--include_aspects`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/3.5.0/cquery.html#cquery-options) flag is used.
- Add support to `bazel/crosstool` for building arm64 on macos.
- Update coverage configuration for Python, `filegroup`, and shell script
  rules to distinguish between source and dependency attributes.
- Add [`InstrumentedFilesInfo`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/3.5.0/skylark/lib/InstrumentedFilesInfo.html)
  provider to Starlark globals.
- Make `filegroup` always forward `InstrumentedFilesProvider` and not
  collect any sources directly.
- Update Starlark error reporting and the call stack.
  This may cause changes in the locations where errors were previously reported.
- Allow dot ('.') in `workspace` names. See [#11837](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/11837).
