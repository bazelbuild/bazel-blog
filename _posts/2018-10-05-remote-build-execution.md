**Update: Google Cloud RBE is no longer available to external customers**

Remote Build Execution can accelerate your software builds and tests and
help you cut infrastructure costs. This Bazel-compatible service is now
available on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) in alpha.

[Join the Alpha Customers group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rbe-alpha-customers)
to learn more and to try it for yourself.

To learn more about remote execution and Bazel, see
[Remote Execution Overview](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/remote-execution.html).
