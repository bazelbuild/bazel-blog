title: Google Summer of Code 2017
---

Thank you very much to everyone who applied for [Google Summer of
Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/) with Bazel. We received
many interesting proposals, and we are excited to see that so many of you are
enthusiastic about Bazel. Since this is the first Google Summer of Code with
Bazel, we decided to mentor only one student. Of course, you are all welcome to
[contribute](https://bazel.build/contributing.html) to our projects, even if it
is outside of Google Summer of Code.

Harmandeep is going to work with us on Bazel this summer, and will develop a
tool to provide editor services (e.g. code completion) for BUILD and .bzl files,
using the [Microsoft Language Server
Protocol](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol). For more
information, you can [check the
proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16FiwRfkwNlcaAysMChphr07WCKuvO6_6G9z8u1Qupbk/edit)
and follow [Harmandeep's blog](https://harmanio.wordpress.com/).

A big thank you to everyone who applied!
