We just got Bazel stickers and we'd like to send them to all of the people who
have sent us pull requests and patches over the last month. If you'd like
some stickers, please [send us](mailto:kchodorow@google.com?subject=Send me stickers!)
your Github username and mailing address.

Let us know if you've done any of the following and we'll send you stickers:

* Gone through a Gerrit code review.
* Opened a pull request on GitHub.
* Sent us a patch on the mailing list.
* Are in the process of doing any of the things above.

Thanks for your contributions, we really appreciate them.
