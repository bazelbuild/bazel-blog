We’re pleased to announce that BazelCon 2019 will be held in Sunnyvale, California at Google’s Moffett Place Campus
on December 11 and 12! ([Link to Map](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Google+Building+MP7,+Sunnyvale,+CA+94089/@37.4063379,-122.0233335,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x808fb7b9f616641b:0x19d5d6ab8d02d7!8m2!3d37.4063337!4d-122.0211448)).
This is THE event for everything related to Bazel, the Bazel Rules Ecosystem, and fast, correct, large scale builds.

Google's Event Center at Moffett Place was designed with events like BazelCon in mind, and is by far
the largest BazelCon venue yet.  We’re excited to be able to accommodate double_ _the number of attendees
from previous years and offer more breakout sessions, extended office hours, and in general provide a more
seamless attendee experience. This is an opportunity for Bazel contributors, maintainers, and all the members
of the Bazel open source community to meet and learn from each other.

The conference agenda is still being shaped, but you can expect:

*   Tech talks, demos, and lightning talks presented by members of the Bazel community
*   Breakout sessions covering
    *   The Bazel rules ecosystem
    *   Language rule specific breakouts
    *   Information about Bazel 1.0
    *   Bazel training and information sharing
*   Office hours with Bazel team members
*   Conference social and networking opportunities
*   ...And more!

As we work to define the agenda, **we need your help**.  Are you interested in giving a talk
or demo?  Do you have content you think we absolutely MUST include?
