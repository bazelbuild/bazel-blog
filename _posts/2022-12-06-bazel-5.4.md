Bazel 5.4.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 5.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.

* Added `rlocationpath(s)` functions suitable for the `Rlocation` function offered by runfiles libraries for smoother transition from Bazel 5.x.x to Bazel 6.0.0 ([#16668](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/16668))
* `package(default_package_metadata=[...])` is now the preferred alternative to `default_applicable_liceneses`. `default_applicable_liceneses` will be removed in a future release. ([#16892](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/16892))
* Fixed hanging issue when Bazel fails to upload action inputs. ([#16819](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/16819))
* Upgraded google-auth-library-oauth2-http dependencies and fixed transitive dependency on opencensus-contrib-http-util 0.31.0. ([#15639](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/15639))
* Fixed coverage generation for C++ when multiple files with the same name are present. ([#16672](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/16672))
* Moved analysis_test into testing.analysis_test, an experimental function intended to be used only by the rules_testing repository. The move makes it easier to support both Bazel 5.4.0 and Bazel 6.0.0. ([#16702](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/16702))
