Bazel 5.1 is a minor release as part of Bazel’s first LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 5.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.

## General

* Bazel now finds runfiles in directories that are themselves runfiles. ([#14737](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/14737))
* Symlinks are no longer resolved for `--sandbox_base`. ([#14748](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/14748))
* Flipped `--experimental_worker_allow_json_protocol` to true. ([#14749](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/14749))
* Enabled native support for Windows on arm64. ([#14794](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/14794))
* Added a new `subpackages()` built-in helper function. ([#14780](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/14780))
* Fixed an issue where Bazel could erroneously report a test passes in coverage mode without actually running the test. ([#14836](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/14836))
* Bazel now uses the new Java API `ProcessHandle` to get the PID. ([#14842](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/14842))

## Apple / Xcode

* Added support for the `tvos_sim_arm64` toolchain. ([#14779](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/14779))
* Fixed `ctx.fragments.apple.single_arch_cpu` returning incorrect cpu for tools when host cpu and exec cpu are different. ([#14751](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/14751))
* Fixed the default CPU for macOS and iOS. ([#14923](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/14923))
* Corrected `cpu` and `os` values of some Apple-related `local_config_cc_toolchains` targets. ([#14995](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/14995))
* Fixed conflicting actions error when specifying `--host_macos_minimum_os`. ([#15068](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/15068))
* `osx_cc_wrapper` now only expands existing response files. ([#15090](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/15090))

## C++

* Added an experimental version of `cc_shared_library`. ([#14773](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/14773))
* Removed uses of `--lstdc++` on Darwin ([#14750](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/14750)) and BSD ([#14860](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/14860)).
* Added the default `solib` directory to the `rpath` for `cc_import`s with transitions. ([#14757](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/14757))
* `rpath` entries are now normalized to guard against missing default `solib` dir. ([#14929](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/14929))
* `--experimental_cc_implementation_deps` now propagates into exec configs. ([#14753](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/14753))

## Configurability

* `alias()` can now `select()` directly on `constraint_value()`. ([#14754](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/14754))
* Added a helper method `use_cpp_toolchain()` to depend on the cc toolchain type. ([#14795](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/14795))
* `Label` instances are now allowed as keys in `select`. ([#14755](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/14755))

## Coverage

* Bazel now no longer includes system headers on macOS in coverage reports ([#14969](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/14969)).
* Exposed `CoverageOutputGenerator` on a Fragment. ([#14997](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/14997))

## External Dependencies

* `UrlRewriter` can now load credentials from `.netrc`. ([#14834](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/14834))
* Added an `arch` field to `repository_os`. ([#14835](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/14835))
* Added support for `WORKSPACE.bzlmod`. ([#14813](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/14813))
* Multiple `use_extension`s are now allowed on the same module extension. ([#14945](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/14945))
* Added `--experimental_repository_cache_urls_as_default_canonical_id` to help detect broken repository URLs. ([#14989](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/14989))
* Added Starlark dependencies to the package `//external`. ([#14991](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/14991))
* Added support for decompressing zstd tar archives in repository rules. ([#15087](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/15087))

## Java

* Bazel now ignores a missing `include` directory in JDK distributions. ([#14832](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/14832))

## Protocol Buffers

* `protocOpts()` is now publicly accessible. ([#14952](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/14952))

## Remote Execution

* The remote module now only waits for background tasks spawned from remote execution. ([#14752](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/14752))
* Postponed the block waiting in `afterCommand` to `BlockWaitingModule`. ([#14833](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/14833))
* Bazel now handles early return of compressed blob uploads. ([#14885](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/14885))
* Changed the default Merkle tree cache size to 1000. ([#14984](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/14984))
* Actions are no longer considered successful and cached if outputs were not created. ([#15071](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/15071))
* Fixed certain crashes by InterruptedException when dynamic execution is enabled. ([#15091](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/15091))

## Starlark

* Added new `removeprefix`/`removesuffix` methods to strings. ([#14899](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/14899))
