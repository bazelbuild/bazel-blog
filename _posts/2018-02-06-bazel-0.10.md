title: "Bazel 0.10"
---

We're proud to announce the release of [Bazel 0.10](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/tag/0.10.0).
The 400+ commits since last release include performance optimizations, bug fixes,
and various improvements.

There is a new android test rule. `android_local_test` tests `android_library`
code using Robolectric, a unit test framework designed for test-driven
development without the need for an emulator or device.

The depset type has evolved. To merge multiple depsets or add new elements, do
not use the operators `+`, `+=`, `|`, or the `.union` method. They are
deprecated and will be removed in the future. Instead use the new `depset`
constructor, which has a better performance. For example, instead of
`d1 + d2 + d3`, use `depset(transitive = [d1, d2, d3])`.
[See the documentation](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/depsets.html)
for more information and examples.

In addition to this new release, the Bazel community has been very active. See
below what happened recently.

Languages & Rules

*   New Python Interest Group! Evan Jones [kickstarted a thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/bazel-discuss/NMO6KPyPKh4/VnxtEVP6EQAJ)
    about Python development on bazel-discuss, which resulted in a new Python
    special interest group. Read [the meeting notes](https://goo.gl/dyd49i) and
    [join the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bazel-sig-python).
*   Alex Eagle has been working on a prototype for [deploying an Angular app to Kubernetes using Bazel](https://medium.com/@Jakeherringbone/deploying-an-angular-app-to-kubernetes-using-bazel-preview-91432b8690b5).
*   Hassan Syed has been working on [new Kotlin rules](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_kotlin),
    using persistent workers to significantly improve the performance.
*   Paul Johnston created some initial [rules for building static websites with hugo](https://github.com/stackb/rules_hugo).
*   Harvey Tuch, a contributor on [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/), wrote a
    blog post about [External C++ dependency management in Bazel](https://blog.envoyproxy.io/external-c-dependency-management-in-bazel-dd37477422f5).

Tools

*   Spotify released [a collection of tools](https://github.com/spotify/bazel-tools)
    for working with Bazel workspaces, mostly tailored towards writing JVM
    backend services.
*   Ever wanted to save a file and have your tests automatically run? How about
    restart your webserver when one of the source files change? Take a look at
    the [Bazel watcher](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-watcher).

Performance

*   Jason Lunz wrote a nice blog post: [We Switched from Maven to Bazel and Builds Got 10x Faster](https://redfin.engineering/we-switched-from-maven-to-bazel-and-builds-got-10x-faster-b265a7845854)
*   Mike Morearty wrote an article about [How to Create a Persistent Worker for Bazel](https://medium.com/@mmorearty/how-to-create-a-persistent-worker-for-bazel-7738bba2cabb).
    This technique gave a 3x speedup of their Typescript compilation.
*   Nicol√≤ Valigi explained [how to get faster Bazel builds with remote caching](https://nicolovaligi.com/faster-bazel-remote-caching-benchmark.html).
*   We added a section on [Remote Caching](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/remote-caching.html)
    to our website. It's a great way to significantly speed up your CI builds.

Did you know?

*   The heart of Bazel is a parallel evaluation and incrementality model called
    [Skyframe](https://bazel.build/designs/skyframe.html).
*   Bazel is more than 10 years old, even though it was just open-sourced 3
    years ago. John Field goes into the prehistory of Bazel in the opening
    remarks of Bazel Conference 2017 [here](https://youtu.be/3eFllvz8_0k?list=PLxNYxgaZ8RseY0KmkXQSt0StE71E7yizG&t=424).
