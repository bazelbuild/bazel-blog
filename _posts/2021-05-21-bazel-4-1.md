Bazel 4.1 is a minor release as part of Bazelâ€™s first LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 4.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.

## Apple / Xcode

* Added support for Apple Silicon. Bazel can now be built natively for Apple Silicon and runs ~2x faster on that platform than the emulated x86_64 version. ([#11628](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/11628), [#12900](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12900), [#12653](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12653))
* Added sanitizer support (asan, tsan and ubsan) to Apple platforms. ([#4984](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/4984), [#6932](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6932), [#12772](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12772))
* Reverted the `-fdebug-compilation-dir` flag to restore compatibility with Xcode 11.3. ([#12905](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12905))
* Improved `cquery` to allow filtering out incompatible targets. This now makes it possible to express queries like "all targets that are compatible with a certain platform". ([#12917](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12917))

## C++

* Added support for `.S` files in C++ Starlark's `cc_common.compile`. ([#13155](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13155))

## cquery

* Removed a non-actionable "Targets were missing from graph" warning printed by `cquery` related to toolchains. ([#11993](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/11993))

## Coverage

* Fixed `bazel coverage` with C++ to work with Remote Execution. ([#13193](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13193), [#13232](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13232))

## External dependencies

* Added SHA-1 to subresource integrity format for `download()` checksums. ([#12777](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12777))
* Fixed `--repo_env` to avoid triggering unnecessary fetches. ([#13126](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13126))
* Fixed `--repo_env=VAR` to prevent a crash when not specifying a value. ([#12886](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12886))
* Added `--experimental_repository_disable_download` that prevents Bazel from downloading external repositories. This can  ensure fully offline builds by overriding all repositories with `local_repository` / `new_local_repository` rules or populating a `--distdir` cache.
* Fixed an issue where invalid URL rewriter configs would cause Bazel to silently crash. The error is now correctly reported. ([#12989](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12989))
* Added support for the `all_blocked_message` directive in the URL rewriter config. It can be used to print a user-friendly custom error message specific to a project or organization. ([#12997](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12997))
* Added support for rewriting the protocol of URLs via the URL rewriter. ([#13114](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13114))

## Java

* Fixed `MANIFEST` section handling in ijar. ([#12730](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12730))
* Updated Turbine to fix a StackOverflowError in error-prone. ([#12926](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12926))

## Platforms

* Updated the embedded `@platforms` repository to `bazelbuild/platforms` release 0.0.2.. ([#11826](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/11826))
* Added the `@platforms//:incompatible` target, which guarantees a target won't build under certain configurations. ([#12690](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12690))
* Improved exec groups so that they can inherit from the rule or other exec groups. ([#13119](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13119))
* Added support and documentation for execution constraints per exec group. ([#13110](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13110), [#13167](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13167))

## Persistent Workers

* Multiplex persistent workers can now use the JSON protocol. Please check [the blog post](https://blog.bazel.build/2020/11/11/json-workers.html) for more information.
* The worker strategy will no longer support the deprecated automatic fallback to non-sandboxed non-worker execution. Instead, the order of strategies to be tried should be configured via the `--strategy=` flag. The old behavior is still supported and enabled by default in Bazel 4.x LTS, but a warning message will now be printed. ([Context](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/3b3e6424c6fbd51d4c4ebb6aa25f1d1f4720221c))
* Various protocol-level, crash, bug and performance fixes.

## Remote Execution
* Updated gRPC to 1.33.1 to fix a corruption issue when downloading CAS blobs. ([#12927](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12927))
* Improved error message for failed uploads by printing the digest of the failed blob. ([#12507](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12507))
* Made error messages for failed executions much more user-friendly by presenting the information embedded in ExecuteResponses in an easily readable format. ([#12564](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12564))
* Fixed the "Must not call uploadBlobs after shutdown" crash when using gRPC Remote Caching and BES. ([#12575](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12575))
* Changed Bazel's behavior to no longer set all files as "executable" when using remote execution. Instead, the executable bit is now correctly passed through from the input file. ([#12818](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12818))
* Improved the logging of WriteRequests to include offset and `finish_write` information. Add logging for QueryWriteStatus calls which occur on progressive writes to determine an offset to begin a write call on a retry. ([#12928](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12928))
* Fixed an issue where builds using remote execution could hang when the server uses gRPC's GOAWAY feature to implement load shedding. ([#12920](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12920))
* Improved performance and interoperability with backends that implement the Remote Execution 2.2 API by setting the platform on the Action message and not just the Command. ([#13134](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13134))
* Fixed an issue where dynamic execution could cause CancellationExceptions. ([#12972](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12972))
* Improved error messages for BulkTransferExceptions to be much more informative and user-friendly by including the actual reason of the failure. ([#13061](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13061))
* Added the `--remote_bytestream_uri_prefix` flag that allows overriding the hostname and instance name in bytestream:// URIs. ([#13085](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13085))
* Improved overall performance and reliability of remote execution by rewriting certain parts with RxJava3.

## User Interface

* Changed the flag `--repo_env` so that it can now be specified in the `common` section of a `.bazelrc` file. ([#12689](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12689))
* Added support for multiple `--bazelrc` flags on the command line. ([#12740](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12740))
* Improved shell autocompletion for `bazel run`. ([#11292](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/11292), [#12957](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12957))

In addition this release contains a couple of other small interoperability, crash, bug and performance fixes.
