We’ve just released [Bazel 0.29](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/tag/0.29.0)! Bazel 0.29 is intended to be backward-compatible with Bazel 0.28 and 0.27, and will be the final release before Bazel 1.0.

Following our [backward compatibility policy](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/backward-compatibility.html), Bazel 1.0 will introduce some [breaking changes](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/labels/breaking-change-1.0). Please follow  "[Updating Bazel](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/updating-bazel.html)" guide to prepare your project for those changes.

Please [report](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/new) any update problems.

## Starlark

*   [`repository_ctx.read`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/lib/repository_ctx.html#read) can now read files from anywhere on the system, and not just within the repository rule context.
*   A new incompatible flag [`--incompatible_disallow_unverified_http_download`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8607) has been added that disallows downloads via `http` (as opposed to `https`) unless a checksum is given. The flag will be flipped in Bazel 1.0 (but remain present throughout the 1.x cycle). To migrate, add a known-good checksum or at least one `https` source for downloading the file.
*   A new incompatible flag [`--incompatible_disable_target_provider_fields`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/9014) removes the ability to access a target's providers via the field syntax (for example, `ctx.attr.dep.my_provider`). The provider-key syntax should be used instead (for example, `ctx.attr.dep[MyProvider]`).


## Execution

*   Added two new tags to better control remote caching/execution: `no-remote-cache` and `no-remote-exec`. Read the [docs](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/common-definitions.html#common-attributes) for details.
*   The [docker sandbox](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/remote-execution-sandbox.html) and the [execution log](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/remote-execution-caching-debug.html) now respect `--remote_default_platform_properties`.
*   The [platform](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/platform.html#platform) attribute `remote_execution_properties` has been deprecated in favor of the newly introduced `exec_properties` attribute.


## Java

*   We fixed remote execution on Windows for the [Java rules](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/java.html). See [#8614](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8614).
*   You can now use a new [`java_toolchain`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/java.html#java_toolchain) target `@remote_java_tools_<PLATFORM>//:prebuilt_toolchain` (where `<PLATFORM>` is one of `darwin`, `linux`, or `windows`) in your builds. The new toolchain uses only pre-built tools, including singlejar and ijar, even on remote execution. The prebuilt toolchain  should be used only when host and execution platform are the same, otherwise the binaries will not work on the execution platform.
*   [`java_common.compile`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/lib/java_common.html#compile) supports specifying `annotation_processor_additional_inputs` and `annotation_processor_additional_outputs`. The API for the Java compilation action enables supporting annotation processors that consume or produce artifacts.


## Android

*   The Android NDK is now integrated with toolchains. To use them, pass the `--extra_toolchains=@androidndk//:all` flag or register them in your WORKSPACE with `register_toolchains("@androidndk//:all")`. Learn more [here](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/android-ndk.html#integration-with-platforms-and-toolchains).
*   There is now documentation on optimizing Android app build performance. Read it [here](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/0.29.0/android-build-performance.html).


## Python

*   Added `--incompatible_load_python_rules_from_bzl`, which will be flipped in a future Bazel version. To migrate, load Python rules from `@rules_python`. See [#9006](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/9006).


## Other

*   Add new incompatible flag `--incompatible_load_proto_rules_from_bzl` to forbid loading the native proto rules. For migration instructions, see tracking issue [#8922](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8922)
*   `rule_test`: fix Bazel 0.27 regression ("tags" attribute was ignored, [#8723](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8723))
*   The `objc_proto_library` rule has been [deleted](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7348) from Bazel.
*   `@build_tools/tools/build_defs/pkg:pkg_deb`, `:pkg_rpm`, and `:pkg_tar` are documented as deprecated. These features are now available independently of Bazel releases on the [`rules_pkg` repository](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_pkg/tree/master/pkg). The original rules will continue to exist until Bazel 2.0.
*   Added a new flag `--//tools/build_defs/pkg:incompatible_no_build_defs_pkg` to forbid loading rules from `//tools/build_defs/pkg:pkg_deb`, `:pkg_rpm`, and `:pkg_tar`.
*   Stdout and stderr are checked to determine if output is going to a terminal. `--is_stderr_atty` is deprecated and `--isatty` is undeprecated.
