[Bazel 3.2](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/tag/3.2.0) has just been released.

## Incompatible changes

Bazel 3.2 is not a major release. As such, updating from Bazel 3.1 is expected to be straightforward.

* The following flags were renamed, removed or replaced:
  `--experimental_slim_json_profile` was renamed to [`--slim_profile`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/3.2.0/command-line-reference.html#flag--slim_profile).


## Starlark

* Action objects created by `ctx.attr.write` now expose their `content` for inspection (in analysis-time tests) even when generated by an `Args` object.
* Starlark rules can now [read](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/3.2.0/skylark/lib/ctx.html#split_attr) attributes that apply Starlark [split transitions](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/3.2.0/skylark/config.html#defining-12-transitions).
* Starlark rules can now create symlinks using [`ctx.actions.symlink`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/3.2.0/skylark/lib/actions.html#symlink).


## aquery

* Added `aquery_differ_v2` that works with the new aquery proto output format.


## Other changes

* Add new flag `--experimental_no_product_name_out_symlink`. When enabled, the `bazel-out` symlink won’t be created if a different name is given to `--symlink_prefix`.
* Bazel can now recursively delete non-executable but readable directories.
