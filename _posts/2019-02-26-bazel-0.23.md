[Bazel 0.23.0](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/tag/0.23.0) has
arrived with an exciting mix of new features, important bug fixes, and updated
documentation.

This version of Bazel has been regression-tested against [51 open-source
projects](https://buildkite.com/bazel/bazel-at-head-plus-downstream/builds/821),
including Gerrit, Protocol Buffers, TensorFlow and the full suite of
rules hosted in bazelbuild's GitHub organization. This makes it our most
comprehensively tested release yet. Want to get your open-source project on
Bazel's CI to ensure that we catch any regressions or have suggestions what we
should test against? [File a GitHub issue.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/continuous-integration/issues/new/choose)


## Incompatible changes

Before updating to Bazel 0.23, first check if your codebase is compatible either
by running [`bazelisk --migrate`](https://github.com/philwo/bazelisk) or by
building your code with Bazel 0.22 and the following flags:

*   [`--incompatible_require_feature_configuration_for_pic`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7007)
*   [`--incompatible_linkopts_in_user_link_flags`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6826)
*   [`--incompatible_dont_emit_static_libgcc`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6825)
*   [`--incompatible_expand_directories`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6762)
*   [`--incompatible_strict_argument_ordering`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6611)
*   [`--incompatible_disallow_data_transition`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6153)
*   [`--incompatible_use_jdk10_as_host_javabase`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6661)
*   [`--incompatible_disable_tools_defaults_package`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6385)
*   [`--incompatible_generate_javacommon_source_jar`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/5824)

For more information about the changes, please click on the links and read the
GitHub issues. Comment there if you need help.

If you use external repositories, you might first have to update the
dependencies in your WORKSPACE file.


## Starlark

*   The [`--incompatible_disallow_struct_provider_syntax`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7347)
    flag has been added. This flag removes the ability for rule implementation
    functions to return a struct. Such functions should return a list of
    providers instead. See the documentation about [Migrating from Legacy
    Providers](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/0.23.0/skylark/rules.html#migrating-from-legacy-providers).
*   Some old flags have been removed: `--incompatible_range_type`,
    `--incompatible_disallow_slash_operator`,
    `--incompatible_disallow_conflicting_providers`.


## Android

*   For [`android_local_test`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/0.23.0/be/android.html#android_local_test),
    you can now use the `aapt_version` attribute or the `--android_aapt` flag to
    pick the aapt version.


## Apple / iOS

*   The `objc_framework` rule has been removed. Please refer to
    `apple_dynamic_framework_import` and `apple_static_framework_import` rules
    available in
    [`rules_apple`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple/blob/master/doc/rules-general.md).
*   The `objc_bundle_library` rule has been removed. Please migrate to
    `rules_apple`'s
    [`apple_resource_bundle`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple/blob/master/doc/rules-resources.md#apple_resource_bundle).
*   Added `--host_swiftcopt` for custom flags to pass to swiftc when building tools written in Swift in the host configuration.
*   Changed the default `apple_platform_type` value from iOS to macOS. You no
    longer need to pass `--apple_platform_type=macos` when building targets on
    macOS that previously required it.


## C++

*   Introduced the
    [`--host_compiler`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/0.23.0/command-line-reference.html#flag--host_compiler)
    flag to allow setting a compiler for host compilation when
    `--host_crosstool_top` is specified.
*   Toolchain resolution for cc rules has been enabled via the incompatible flag
    [`--incompatible_enable_cc_toolchain_resolution`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7260).
    The legacy flag, --enabled_toolchain_types, has been deprecated and will be
    removed.
*   [`cc_common.create_cc_toolchain_config_info`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/0.23.0/skylark/lib/cc_common.html#create_cc_toolchain_config_info)
    is now stable and available for production use. See updated [`cc_toolchain
    tutorial`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/cc-toolchain-config-reference.html)
    and the [reference](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/cc-toolchain-config-reference.html)

## Java

*   Bazel now verifies that `JAVA_HOME` points to a valid JDK. Otherwise, it falls back to
    auto-detection by looking up the path of javac.
*   The [`--incompatible_use_jdk11_as_host_javabase`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7219)
    flag has been added. This flag forces Bazel to use JDK 11 as its default
    `--host_javabase`.
*   The [`--incompatible_generate_javacommon_source_jar`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/5824)
    flag has been added. This flag forces `java_common.compile` to always generate
    a source .jar file.
*   The [`--incompatible_use_toolchain_providers_in_java_common`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7186)
    flag has been added. This flag forces Bazel to pass JavaToolchainInfo and
    JavaRuntimeInfo providers to `java_common` APIs instead of configured targets.
*   An optional `output_source_jar` parameter has been added to
    [`java_common.compile`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/0.23.0/skylark/lib/java_common.html#compile).


## Python

*   Python rules now accept and return a
    [PyInfo](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/0.23.0/skylark/lib/PyInfo.html)
    provider in addition to the legacy "py" struct provider, which is being
    deprecated. You can preview the deprecation by enabling
    [--incompatible_disallow_legacy_py_provider](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7298)
*   The `default_python_version` attribute and `--force_python` flags are being
    renamed. Use `python_version` and `--python_version` respectively instead.
    You can preview the removal of the deprecated names with
    [`--incompatible_remove_old_python_version_api`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7308). 
*   The `--python_version` flag will soon no longer override the declared
    version of a `py_binary` or `py_test` target. This allows Python 3 binaries
    to have data dependencies on Python 2 binaries and vice versa. You can
    preview this new behavior with
    [`--incompatible_allow_python_version_transitions`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7307).


## aquery

*   Documentation for the `aquery` command is [now
    available](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/aquery.html).
*   [Chaining](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7024) of the same
    function type (inputs, outputs, mnemonic) in `aquery` is now allowed.
*   The content of parameter files can now be displayed in `aquery` output using
    the  `--include_param_files` flag.
*   `aquery` text output now highlights if an artifact is a
    [TreeArtifact](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7225).


## Caching & Execution

*   Locally-executed spawns tagged `no-cache` no longer upload their outputs to
    the remote cache.
*   Bazel now supports reading cache hits from a repository cache, even if it
    doesn't have write access to the cache.
*   Fixed a longstanding bug in the HTTP remote cache where the value passed to
    `--remote_timeout` would be interpreted as milliseconds instead of seconds.
*   The incompatible flag
    [`--incompatible_strict_action_env`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6648)
    has been flipped to "false" again, as we discovered breakages for local
    execution users. We'll need some more time to figure out the best way to
    make this work for local and remote execution
    ([#7026](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7026)).
*   The flag value `--test_sharding_strategy=experimental_heuristic` has been
    removed.


## Other changes

*   Bazel binary is 20MB smaller by using a minimized embedded JDK.
*   The embedded JDK version is upgraded to 11.0.2.
*   Incompatible flag
    [`--incompatible_auto_configure_host_platform`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7081)
    has been added. When set, the default value of `--host_platform` and
    `--platforms` will not be dependent on the configuration. This means that
    setting `--cpu` or `--host_cpu` will not affect the target or host platform.
*   Introduces
    [`--local_ram_resources`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/0.23.0/command-line-reference.html#flag--local_ram_resources)
    and
    [`--local_cpu_resources`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/0.23.0/command-line-reference.html#flag--local_cpu_resources),
    which will take the place of `--local_resources`.
*   In
    [`--keep_going`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/0.23.0/user-manual.html#flag--keep_going)
    mode, Bazel now correctly returns a non-zero exit code when encountering a
    package loading error during target pattern parsing of patterns like
    `//foo:all` and `//foo/...`.
*   For tests that do not generate a `test.xml`, Bazel now uses a separate
    action to generate one; this results in minor differences in the generated
    `test.xml`, and makes the `test.xml` generation more reliable overall.

    been improved. It can be used to try your code with a specific version of
    Bazel, or to ensure your code is forward compatible (see the `--migrate`
    flag).
