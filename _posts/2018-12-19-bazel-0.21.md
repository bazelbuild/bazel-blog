We've just released [Bazel 0.21](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/tag/0.21.0)!

We also revamped our Android with Bazel tutorial. Check it out [here](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/tutorial/android-app.html).


## Backward compatibility

Before updating Bazel, you may try if anything would break with 0.21. To do so, build your code with Bazel 0.20 and the following flags:

*   [`--incompatible_disable_sysroot_from_configuration`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6565)
*   [`--incompatible_disallow_slash_operator`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/5823)
*   [`--incompatible_static_name_resolution`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/5637)
*   [`--incompatible_package_name_is_a_function`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/5827)
*   [`--incompatible_use_remotejdk_as_host_javabase`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6656)
*   [`--incompatible_provide_cc_toolchain_info_from_cc_toolchain_suite`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6537)
*   [`--incompatible_disable_depset_in_cc_user_flags`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6383)
*   [`--incompatible_disable_late_bound_option_defaults`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6384)
*   [`--experimental_strict_action_env`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6648)

For more information about the changes, please click on the links and read the GitHub issues. Comment there if you need help.

If you use external repositories, you might first have to update the dependencies in your WORKSPACE file.

Changes for which 0.21 is a [migration window](
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dj5PBLmPVg9ZyApm4GobM3y-mDgY3mVaqpRVttOe-ZQ/edit)
are marked with GitHub label [migration-0.21](
https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Amigration-0.21).

Breaking changes in the next release (0.22) are marked with GitHub label
[breaking-change-0.22](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Abreaking-change-0.22).


## Android

*   [`--experimental_check_desugar_deps`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/command-line-reference.html#flag--experimental_check_desugar_deps)
    is enabled by default. This flag rules out several types of invalid Android
    builds at compile-time. Note that this is incompatible with remote Android
    builds, so you can disable it with `--noexperimental_check_desugar_deps`.
*   Bazel now supports Android Databinding v2. It can be enabled with
    [`--experimental_android_databinding_v2`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/command-line-reference.html#flag--experimental_android_databinding_v2).


## Apple

*   `XCRUNWRAPPER_LABEL` is removed. If you used this value before, please use @bazel_tools//tools/objc:xcrunwrapper instead.


## C++

*   The `--experimental_stl` command line option is removed.
*   [`cpp` configuration
    fragment](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/lib/cpp.html)
    doesn't do package loading anymore. That means:
    *   You can now use Bazel without a C++ toolchain (as long as you don't build C++ rules).
    *   Bazel may start about 2 seconds faster than before, because it does not analyze C++ toolchain anymore when it is not needed.

## Java

*   `--strict_android_deps` and `--strict_java_deps` are renamed to `--experimental_strict_java_deps`. (The two flags used to do the same.)

## Starlark

*   A new incompatible flag [`--incompatible_strict_argument_ordering`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6611) is added. This concerns a corner case in function calls. When this flag is enabled, `*arg` and `**kwarg` have to be after all other arguments.

## External repositories

*   [`repository_ctx.download`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/lib/repository_ctx.html#download) and [`repository_ctx.download_and_extract`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/lib/repository_ctx.html#download_and_extract) now return a struct, instead of `None`.


## Execution

*   `--genrule_strategy` is deprecated in favor of [`--strategy=Genrule=<strategy>`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/command-line-reference.html#flag--strategy) (for genrules) or [`--spawn_strategy=<strategy>`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/command-line-reference.html#flag--spawn_strategy) (for all actions).
*   Dynamic execution is now available with [`--experimental_spawn_scheduler`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/command-line-reference.html#flag--experimental_spawn_scheduler). Dynamic execution allows a build action to run locally and remotely simultaneously, and Bazel picks the fastest action. This provides the best of both worlds: faster clean builds than pure local builds, and faster incremental builds than pure remote builds.


## Other changes

*   [aquery](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/user-manual.html#aquery)
    defaults to human readable output format, use `--output=proto` to get the
    result in proto format..
*   The deprecated and unmaintained Docker rules in `tools/build_defs/docker`
    are removed. Please use
    [`https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_docker`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_docker)
    instead.
*   A new incompatible flag
    [`--incompatible_merge_genfiles_directory`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6761)
    is added. When enabled, Bazel does not create a `bazel-genfiles` directory,
    and writes everything to `bazel-bin` instead.
*   When build options change, Bazel discards the analysis cache. The changed
    options are now printed in the output. It is possible to control the number
    of options to show using
    [`--max_config_changes_to_show`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/command-line-reference.html#flag--max_config_changes_to_show).
*   [`--experimental_remote_grpc_log`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/command-line-reference.html#flag--experimental_remote_grpc_log)
    now also logs updateActionResult. This is the Remote Execution API call used
    in remote caching, so now remote caching
    [can be debugged](https://github.com/bazelbuild/tools_remote/) using the grpc log.

## Community

*   Natan Silnitsky talked about Wix's [lessons learned for successful migration to Bazel and Google Cloud Build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKx21CsT744) to build their Scala codebase.
*   David Stanke also did a talk: [Build and test your code faster with Bazel, the cloud-accelerated build system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqRpf7rJvP4).
*   Philipp Wollermann created [Bazelisk](https://github.com/philwo/bazelisk), a wrapper for Bazel that automatically picks a good version of Bazel given your current working directory.
*   John Millikin started new rules for the [GNU m4](https://github.com/jmillikin/rules_m4) macro processor, the [Flex](https://github.com/jmillikin/rules_flex) scanner generator, and the [GNU Bison](https://github.com/jmillikin/rules_bison) parser generator.

This release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Andy
Scott, Attila Oláh, Benjamin Peterson, Clint Harrison, Dave Lee, Ed Schouten,
Gregor Jasny, Jamie Snape, Jerry Marino, Loo Rong Jie, Or Shachar, Sevki
Hasirci, and William Chargin.

Thanks to everyone who contributed!
