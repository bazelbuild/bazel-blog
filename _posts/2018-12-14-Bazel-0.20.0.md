## General Changes

  - (Linux only) Bazel now shuts down when idle for 5 minutes and the system
    is low on RAM.
  - We're deprecating `--genrule_strategy=<value>` with the intent of removing it in early 2019; please use `--strategy=Genrule=<value>` instead
    (see [#6760](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6760)).
  - Bazel now queryies remote server Capabilities (per REAPI v2)
  - Use different server log files per Bazel server process; java.log
    is now a symlink to the latest log.
  - The code coverage report now includes the actual paths to header
    files instead of the ugly, Bazel generated, virtual includes path.
  - Bazel sorts remote Platform properties for remote execution. 

## C++

  - The `--experimental_no_dotd_scanning_with_modules` command line argument is not supported anymore.
  - The `--prune_cpp_modules` command line option is not supported anymore.
  - The `--experimental_prune_cpp_input_discovery` command line option is not supported anymore.
  - All `cc_toolchains` depended on from `cc_toolchain_suite.toolchains` are now analyzed when not using
    platforms in order to select the right `cc_toolchain`.
  - CROSSTOOL file is now read from the package of `cc_toolchain`, not from
    the package of `cc_toolchain_suite`. This is not expected to break anybody since
    `cc_toolchain_suite` and `cc_toolchain` are commonly in the same package.
  - All `cc_toolchains` dependent on from `cc_toolchain_suite.toolchains` are now analyzed when not using
    platforms in order to select the right `cc_toolchain`.
    
## Java

  - The`--explicit_jre_deps` flag is removed.
  - If the `--javabase` flag is unset, Bazel locates a JDK using the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable 
    and searching the PATH. If no JDK is found, `--javabase` is empty and builds targeting Java
    will not be supported. Previously Bazel would fall back to using the embedded  JDK as a `--javabase`,
    but this is no longer default behaviour. A JDK should be explicitly installed instead to enable Java development.

## Android

  - Added support for Android NDK r18.
  - Make legacy-test-support (`legacy_test-<api-level>`) from
    `android_sdk_repository` neverlink. The legacy test support libraries
    shouldn't be built into test binaries. To make them available at runtime,
    [developers should declare them via
    uses-library](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/set-up-project#android-test-base).
    
## Starlark

  - All overrides of Starlark's `ctx.new_file` function are now
    deprecated. Try the `--incompatible_new_actions_api` flag to ensure your
    code is forward-compatible.
  - The function `attr.license` is deprecated. It can be disabled now
    with `--incompatible_no_attr_license`.
  - The 'default' parameter of `attr.output` and `attr.output_list` has been removed. This is controlled by
    `--incompatible_no_output_attr_default`
  - A number of platform-related Starlark APIs which were previously
    marked "experimental" are now disabled by default, and may be
    enabled via `--experimental_platforms_api`
