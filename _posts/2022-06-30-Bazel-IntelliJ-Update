# **Bazel IntelliJ Plugin Community Update**

  
Thank you all for your continued support and contributions to the [Bazel IntelliJ plugin](https://github.com/bazelbuild/intellij) provided by Google. At Google we are always thinking of ways to empower the open source community and in light of that we have an announcement on change in repository maintenance with support for JetBrains.

JetBrains is partnering with Google to co-maintain the Bazel IntelliJ Plugin, and we are planning to create a public repository that can be contributed by Google, JetBrains and other contributors. This repository will be forked from the Bazel IntelliJ plugin repo currently owned and maintained by Google. What this means is that community members will play the role of maintainers and will review and merge community contributions along with co-maintainers (Google + JetBrains). This will accelerate the adoption of community contributions benefitting all users at large.
