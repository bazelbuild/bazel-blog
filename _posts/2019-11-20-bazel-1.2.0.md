We've just released [Bazel 1.2](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/tag/1.2.0)!

Bazel 1.2 is intended to be [backward-compatible](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/backward-compatibility.html) with Bazel 1.0.

Please [report](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/new) any update problems.

## Android

* `android_binary` and `android_library` can now depend on targets providing `CcInfos`. See [#9079](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/9079) for details.
* Experimental support for d8 dexers (both standalone and incremental) is now available for use using `--nouse_workers_with_dexbuilder` `--define=android_incremental_dexing_tool=d8_dexbuilder`. See [#5150](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/5150) for details.
* Added Desugar support for `FreezePeriod#<init>`.

## Query

* Fixed an aquery bug with handling malformed queries that crashes Bazel.

## macOS / iOS

* Fixed [a bug](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/10184) that broke caching for all builds on macOS.

## C++

* The `cc_common.{compile,link}` APIs can now be used without passing the `--experimental_cc_skylark_api_enabled_packages` flag.
* Incompatible flag [`--incompatible_validate_top_level_header_inclusions`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/10047) has been added.
* Fields on `CcLinkingOutputs` are now listed.

## Platforms

* `--target_platform_fallback` now also applies to exec / host configurations

## Python

* Added flag [`--incompatible_default_to_explicit_init_py`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/10076) to switch the default value of [`legacy_create_init`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/python.html#py_binary.legacy_create_init) to False. With this flag enabled, your `py_binary` and `py_test` targets will no longer behave as if empty `__init__.py` files were implicitly littered in your runfiles tree.

## Documentation and UX

* Bazel will now prevent idle sleep during test and build actions. Note that this does not affect screensavers and will not keep a laptop awake if the user forces sleep or closes the lid. This is purely to avoid idle sleeping when the user is not interacting with the device.
* Added support for tracking suspensions (sleeps or SIGSTOP) on macOS.
* BUILD/.bzl execution errors now cause execution to stop, even at top-level.
* A list of log paths will now be provided in the build output.
* Improved [runfiles documentation](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/rules.html#runfiles).

## Community updates
