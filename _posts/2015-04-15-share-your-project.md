We're setting up a list of projects using Bazel. If you'd like us
to list your project on [bazel.build](http://bazel.build),
[send us](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bazel-discuss/5XaCYQOdN8o/DHE9H4ygHiYJ)
the following information:

1. The project's name.
2. The language(s) it's using.
3. Whether it uses Bazel + another build system or just Bazel.
4. Any nice surprises/blockers you've run into using Bazel.
5. Any other info or comments you have!

If you don't want your project publicly listed, we'd still love to hear about
it. Please [email us](mailto:bazel-core@googlegroups.com) directly and let us know.
