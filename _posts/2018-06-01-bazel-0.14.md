We've just released [Bazel 0.14](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/tag/0.14.0)!


## BUILD and bzl files



*   Labels starting with more than two slashes are disallowed (e.g. `///foo`).
*   The `/` operator is deprecated in favor of `//` (floor integer division). Try the `--incompatible_disallow_slash_operator` flag to ensure your code is forward-compatible.
*   [Args objects](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/lib/Args.html) (`ctx.actions.args()`) have new methods [`add_all()`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/lib/Args.html#add_all) and [`add_joined()`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/lib/Args.html#add_joined) for building command lines using depsets. The [`add()`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/lib/Args.html#add) method has a new overload: `args.add("--foo", val)`.
*   Added flag `--incompatible_disallow_old_style_args_add` to help migrate from `args.add()` to `args.add_all()` or `args.add_joined()` where appropriate.
*   [FileType](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/lib/FileType.html) is deprecated and will be removed soon. Try the `--incompatible_disallow_filetype` flag to ensure your code is forward-compatible.
*   Removed flag `--incompatible_disallow_toplevel_if_statement`.
*   Introduce `tools` parameter to [`ctx.actions.run`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/lib/actions.html#run) and [`ctx.actions.run_shell`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/lib/actions.html#run_shell). Tools are label-type attributes marked `executable=True`, whose runfiles are available to the action. Currently tools are passed in using the `inputs` parameter, but in the future it will be required to pass them through `tools` instead.


## sh rules



*   You can now access runfiles (data-dependencies) from shell scripts in `sh_*` rules in a platform-independent way. See top of [//tools/bash/runfiles/runfiles.bash](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/tools/bash/runfiles/runfiles.bash) for usage information.


## C++



*   `optional_compiler_flag` field was removed from `CROSSTOOL`. Use `features` instead.
*   Fixed [start/end lib](https://github.com/llvm-mirror/lld/blob/master/ELF/Options.td#L282) expansion for linking used with `ld.gold` and `lld`. There were many cases where archive files were still being used with toolchains that support start/end lib.
*   Introduce [`fdo_profile`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/cpp.html#fdo_profile) rule that allows architecture-sensitive specification of fdo profiles. This rule has the same function as [`--fdo_optimize`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/user-manual.html#flag--fdo_optimize) and will replace it in the future.


## Java



*   In `java_toolchain`, allow [`header_compiler`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/java.html#java_toolchain.header_compiler) to be an arbitrary executable.
*   [`java_common.compile`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/lib/java_common.html#compile) now uses [`java_toolchain.javacopts`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/java.html#java_toolchain.javacopts) by default; explicitly retrieving them using the experimental `java_common.default_javac_opts` is unnecessary.
*   The JavaInfo provider created by [`java_common.create_provider`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/lib/java_common.html#create_provider) now includes both direct and transitive arguments in [`JavaInfo.transitive_compile_time_jars`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/lib/JavaInfo.html#transitive_compile_time_jars) and [`JavaInfo.transitive_runtime_jars`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/lib/JavaInfo.html#transitive_runtime_jars).
*   Add `--incompatible_disallow_legacy_javainfo` flag to make an error the use of old-style JavaInfo provider construction methods ([`java_common.create_provider`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/lib/java_common.html#create_provider) and [`JavaInfo()`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/lib/JavaInfo.html#modules.JavaInfo)).
*   Add a new [`JavaInfo`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/lib/JavaInfo.html) provider constructor. See [design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ubah6phuvWnugShtVgSQnaopQ1BtKtNxQASVwGZA7k0/edit).


## Other changes



*   Command [canonicalize-flags](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/command-line-reference.html#canonicalize-flags) no longer reorders the flags.
*   Remove vestigial `deps` and `data` attributes from `proto_lang_toolchain`
*   `bazel run` now lets one run interactive binaries. The `BUILD_WORKSPACE_DIRECTORY` and `BUILD_WORKING_DIRECTORY` environment variables indicate the working directory and the workspace root of the Bazel invocation. Tests are provided with an approximation of the official test environment.
*   Repository rules are no longer restricted to return `None`. This is the first step in the transition towards generating WORKSPACE.resolved files, where source-like repository rules are expected to return the information needed to be a reproducible versions of themselves (for more details see the [design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kVNXcw3nLlfFQRR_87SGOka9DJ8nnawlYHUIK4m3s0I/)). At the moment, the return value is simply ignored (and debug-printed), but lifting the restriction allows rules to transition already.
*   Bazel now supports running actions inside Docker containers. To use this feature, run `bazel build --spawn_strategy=docker --experimental_docker_image=myimage:latest`.
*   Remote execution works for [Windows binaries with launchers](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/4962).
*   We replaced the `--experimental_local_disk_cache` and `--experimental_local_disk_cache_path` flags into a single [`--disk_cache`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/remote-caching.html#disk-cache) flag. Additionally, Bazel now tries to create the disk cache directory if it doesn't exist.
*   Allow --[worker_max_instances](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/command-line-reference.html#flag--worker_max_instances) to take `MnemonicName=value` to specify max for each worker.


## Community



*   We shared plans around a [Rules Curation process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oYQ-cqmqrpVE02rphobn4F_Q-lqvch4IiUlqEy9q2Fs/edit). The goal is to promote a set of high quality rules, reduce breakages and improve stability of these rules.
*   Yugui wrote a prototype version of [rules\_ruby](https://github.com/yugui/rules_ruby).
*   There is a new Google codelab on [Building Android Apps with Bazel](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/bazel-android-intro/index.html).
*   cabal2bazel, a tool for fetching Haskell Cabal packages from Hackage into Bazel, was [recently open sourced](https://github.com/google/cabal2bazel).
*   Luc Perkins has created [Colossus](https://github.com/lucperkins/colossus), a project on GitHub showing how Bazel can be used in a multi-lingual, microservice-driven setting. It uses Kubernetes, Go, Java, Docker, and gRPC.
*   Ed Schouten started new [rules for Latex](https://github.com/ProdriveTechnologies/bazel-latex).
