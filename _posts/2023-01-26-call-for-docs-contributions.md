title: A call for contributions to Bazel’s documentation

Last year, we made significant changes to Bazel’s documentation website ([bazel.build](https://bazel.build/)) to elevate overall developer experience. By redesigning the site’s architecture, we’ve made it easier for the community to contribute new documentation and add more content. 

In 2023, we aim to improve Bazel’s documentation and eliminate common issues. We can achieve this goal by reducing the number of open GitHub documentation issues in a sustainable way. 

Here’s where we’d like your support:
1. Join our [Slack channel](https://app.slack.com/client/TA4K1KQ87/C04JVKPP4EB)! This is where we will collaborate and engage with you on documentation contributions.
2. Look through the [pre-filtered link](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ateam-Documentation+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+) of open issues in the bazelbuild/bazel repository. (Optionally, you can filter by issues labeled “team-Documentation” and “help wanted” yourself.)
3. Identify issues that you can assist with and assign them to yourself. This lets other community members know that you are working on them. 
4. If you’re new to this community, look out for issues labeled “good first issue” - these are handpicked by the Bazel team as good introductory problems to work on.
5. Go to the page you would like to update and click on the “View Source” button found on top. This will direct you to the correct file in the docs section of the repository.

7. Make the required updates and submit a PR.


And that’s it! Our new internal processes will take care of the rest.

We encourage you all to contribute to Bazel’s documentation! By sharing what you know and learn, you’re helping us grow, strengthen, and foster our amazing community of developers. Let us know if we can help in any way during the process - reach out to Radhika Advani on Slack, or post on our dedicated [channel](https://app.slack.com/client/TA4K1KQ87/C04JVKPP4EB).
