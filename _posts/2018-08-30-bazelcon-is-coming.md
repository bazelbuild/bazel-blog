BazelCon is coming! Building on the success of last year’s first-ever Bazel User Conference, we’re excited to host 
this year's conference in New York City. __[BazelCon 2018](https://conf.bazel.build)__ is on October 9-10, and will 
feature technical presentations, hands-on expert consultations, SIG meetups, and, for the first time, a Bazel Boot 
Camp for beginners. 

So much has happened in the Bazel community since last year. We’re eager to hear your stories and learn about the 
tools and techniques you’ve developed. We will also give updates on new features, best practices, and the road ahead 
for Bazel. There will be hundreds of technologists in attendance, with a wide range of experiences and interests. 
This is a unique opportunity to share and learn.

Space is limited, and we cannot accept walk-ins, so
