title: A new logo and homepage for Bazel
---

We are glad to unveil a new logo for Bazel:

![Bazel logo](/images/bazel-icon.svg)

This new logo, which feels more modern and balanced, was designed by [Sunkwan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sunkwan), creative lead at Google.
It takes inspiration from assembled blocks, adds an emotional touch to it and keeps the green color that is now rooted into our identity.
It was the top results of our internal and community votes.

We also updated the homepage of the Bazel website: [https://bazel.build](https://bazel.build)

In addition to a visual refresh, this new website features clearer value statements, clearer call to actions and more relevant 'Get Started' links.
We are also very proud to showcase a few famous users and their testimonials (feel free to add yours [in the dedicated page of our wiki](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/wiki/Bazel-Users)).

Along the way, we moved the content of the main website and the blog in dedicated repositories ([site repo](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-website), [blog repo](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-blog)) and are using different subdomains: The documentation, which source is still hosted with our code in our main [bazelbuild/bazel](github.com/bazelbuild/bazel) repo, is now served at [docs.bazel.build](https://docs.bazel.build). The blog is served at [blog.bazel.build](http://blog.bazel.build/), which should streamline the blog publication process (contributions welcome!).

The work does not stop here, our next steps are to improve our documentation structure and 'Getting Started' content.
By the way, feel free to suggest edits to our documentation, it is as easy as clicking the 'Edit' button at the top of documentation pages.

We hope you like this new visual identity.
