[Bazel 3.1](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/tag/3.1.0) has just
been released.

## Incompatible changes

Bazel 3.1 is not a major release. As such, updating from Bazel 3.0 is expected to be straightforward.

* The following obsolete flags have been removed:
  `--experimental_oom_more_eagerly`,
  `experimental_oom_more_eagerly_threshold`,
  `--incompatible_bzl_disallow_load_after_statement`,
  `--incompatible_no_output_attr_default`,
  `--incompatible_restrict_named_params`, `--incompatible_depset_union`,
  `--incompatible_load_proto_toolchain_for_javalite_from_com_google_protobuf`.
* A maximum attribute name length of 128 is enforced, as well as a maximum 200
  attributes per rule is enforced. These limitations were chosen to be large,
  and we donâ€™t expect anyone to hit them. They allow Bazel to fail gracefully
  before internal limitations are reached.


## C++

* Allow assembly file sources in [`cc_common.compile`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/3.1.0/skylark/lib/cc_common.html#compile).
* Add stamp parameter for [`cc_common.link`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/3.1.0/skylark/lib/cc_common.html#link) to enable including build info.


## Starlark

* Aspects may now propagate through dependencies on rule outputs by being
  defined with [`apply_to_generating_rules = True`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/3.1.0/skylark/lib/globals.html#aspect).
* `query --output=build` now shows where rule classes are defined (in addition to where rule targets are instantiated).


## Other changes

* The
  [`--target_pattern_file`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/3.1.0/command-line-reference.html#flag--target_pattern_file)
  flag provides a way to supply any number of targets to bazel, regardless of
  operating system limits on command line length.
* The default `.netrc` file on Windows is set to `%USERPROFILE%`.
* The [`patch` function](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/3.1.0/repo/utils.html#patch)
  can handle file permission properly.
