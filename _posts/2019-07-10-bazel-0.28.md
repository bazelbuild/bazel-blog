We’ve just released [Bazel 0.28](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/tag/0.28.0)! Bazel 0.28 is intended to be backward-compatible with Bazel 0.27. Please [report](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/new) any update problem.


## Starlark



*   The flag [`--incompatible_restrict_escape_sequences`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8380) is added. This will affect escape sequences in Starlark strings.
*   The `outputs` parameter of the `rule()` function is deprecated and attached to flag `--incompatible_no_rule_outputs_param`. Migrate rules to use `OutputGroupInfo` or `attr.output` instead. See [migration notes](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7977) for more information.
*   Attribute names are going [to be restricted](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6437) and must be syntactically valid identifiers.
*   The `info` command now supports the `starlark-semantics` argument, which outputs a representation of the effective Starlark semantics option values.
*   The `command` parameter of the `actions.run_shell()` function will be restricted to only accept strings (and not string sequences). This check is attached to flag `--incompatible_run_shell_command_string`. One may migrate by using the `arguments` parameter of `actions.run()` instead. See [migration notes](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/5903) for more information.


## Android

*   Fixed treatment of `<dist:module />` tags in AndroidManifest.xml.
*   Fixed treatment of AndroidManifest.xml attributes which contained XML escaping.
*   Fixed asset precedence for `android_binary` rules with aapt2.


## Java



*   `@bazel_tools//tools/jdk:toolchain_java10` and `@bazel_tools//tools/jdk:toolchain_java11` are now available to enable java 10, respectively java 11 language level support.
*   `--incompatible_load_java_rules_from_bzl` was added to forbid loading the native java rules directly. See more on tracking issue #8746


## C++



*   Bazel's C++ autoconfiguration now understands `BAZEL_LINKLIBS` environment variable to specify system libraries that should be appended to the link command line.
*   [`--incompatible_disable_nocopts`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8706) flag has been added.
*   The runtime dynamic libraries are no longer in default output group of `cc_binary`.
*   The experimental flag `experimental_link_compile_output_separately` is removed. The same behavior is available through the feature `dynamic_link_test_srcs`.
*   Set the FDOBuildType as CSFDO for binaries built with [`--cs_fdo_absolute_path`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/command-line-reference.html#flag--cs_fdo_absolute_path).


## Configurations



*   Turn on `--experimental_build_setting_api` by default to allow [user-defined build settings](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/config.html#user-defined-build-settings).
*   The incompatible change [`--incompatible_use_platforms_repo_for_constraints`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8622) has been added.


## Remote Execution



*   All known issues ([#8646](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8646), [#8385](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8385)) of "[Builds without the Bytes](https://blog.bazel.build/2019/05/07/builds-without-bytes.html)" have been fixed.
*   “Builds without the Bytes” now supports the Build Event Service (BES).
*   The dynamic spawn strategy is now supported by remote execution.


## Other changes



*   Bazel now supports hiding compiler warnings for targets that you're not explicitly building. See the flag [`--auto_output_filter`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/user-manual.html#flag--auto_output_filter).
*   Add `--incompatible_enable_profile_by_default` to enable the JSON profile by default.
*   When `--incompatible_strict_action_env` is enabled, the default `PATH` now includes `/usr/local/bin`.
*   Paths under the execution root starting with `.` or `_` will be re-linked across builds
*   Bazel now officially supports running on CentOS 7.
*   Bazel can now be bootstrapped and built on arm64 platforms without requiring any flags or patches.


## Community



*   Grakn published [Bazel rules for assembling and deploying software distributions](https://github.com/graknlabs/bazel-distribution).
*   Dan Frank created [databazel](https://github.com/danielhfrank/databazel) - build rules for executing machine learning workflows.
*   Lewis Hemens from Dataform wrote an article about [Building a TypeScript monorepo with Bazel](https://dev.to/lewish/building-a-typescript-monorepo-with-bazel-4o7n).
