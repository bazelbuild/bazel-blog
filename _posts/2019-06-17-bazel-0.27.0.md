[Bazel 0.27](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/tag/0.27.0) has just been released.

With Bazel 0.27, we start a 3 month stability window. Bazel 0.28 and Bazel 0.29
will be backward compatible with Bazel 0.27. See our announcement about
[Bazel Stability and Semantic Versioning](https://blog.bazel.build/2019/06/06/Bazel-Semantic-Versioning.html).
This release contains more incompatible changes than usual, as we try to fix the
important issues before Bazel 1.0.


## Incompatible changes

Bazel 0.27 Linux release binaries have been built on Ubuntu 16.04 (before:
Ubuntu 14.04, which is now EOL). This change will probably break compatibility
with older Linux distributions like Ubuntu 14.04. If this causes you problems,
please [open an issue](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues) and let us know.


Before updating to Bazel 0.27, first check if your codebase is compatible either
by running [`bazelisk --migrate`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk) or by
building your code with Bazel 0.26 and the following flags:

*   [`--incompatible_disable_deprecated_attr_params`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/5818)
*   [`--incompatible_depset_for_libraries_to_link_getter`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8118)

If you use external repositories, you might first have to update the
dependencies in your WORKSPACE file.


## Android



*   Introduced the `--incompatible_disable_native_android_rules` flag. This flag
    facilitates the migration of the Android native rules to Starlark. For more
    information, see
    [Android Native to Starlark Migration](https://docs.google.com/document/d/175BlYH-Z_V_FFGAVP-JA5FowLATRjY_MtOrglxFnfcE/edit).
*   Android desugaring actions now use persistent workers by default. This has
    been measured to provide up to 20% reduction in build times. To disable it,
    use the `--strategy=Desugar=sandboxed` flag. See [Bazel issue 8342](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8342)
    and [Bazel issue 8427](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8427)
    for more details on local build speed optimization for Android apps.
*   Fixed an issue with Android builds where `--fat_apk_cpu` doesn't pack all
    selected shared libraries from `aar_import` targets into the APK. See
    [Bazel issue 8283](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8283).
*   Added support for Android NDK 19 and 20.
*   Optimized build times further by 10% by trimming unused build actions. See [Bazel issue 8340](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8340) for more details.


## Apple platforms


*   `BAZEL_USE_XCODE_TOOLCHAIN=1` tells Bazel not to look for Xcode to decide
    whether to enable toolchains for Apple rules, but to assume Xcode is
    available. It can be also used when building on Darwin and no C++ or ObjC is
    being built, so there is no need to detect Xcode.


## C++



*   Added a generic
    [`additional_linker_inputs`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/c-cpp.html#cc_binary.additional_linker_inputs)
    attribute on `cc_binary` rules.
*   Windows, C++ autoconfigure: `BAZEL_VC` and `BAZEL_VS` can now use quotes.
    If you set these envvars' values in `cmd.exe` via TAB-completion, you no
    longer need to remove the surrounding quotes.
*   `cc_import()` of a DLL with no interface library on Windows is now allowed.
    This is used to document runtime dependencies.
*   Repository containing autoconfigured C++ toolchain `@local_config_cc` has
    been split. See `local_config_cc_toolchains`.
*   Added new option
    [`--cs_fdo_absolute_path=`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/command-line-reference.html#flag--cs_fdo_absolute_path)
    to support the absolute path profile for LLVM's context-sensitive FDO.


## Python



*   Python rules now find the Python runtime using toolchains, rather than the
    `--python_top` and `--python_path` flags, which are deprecated. See the
    [migration issue](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7899) for more
    information on declaring Python toolchains and migrating your code.
*   As a side-benefit of enabling toolchains, Bazel now enforces that Python
    targets execute under the same version of Python that was determined in the
    analysis phase (fixing
    [#4815](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/4815)), on all platforms
    besides Windows. This means that **builds may start to fail with Python 2 vs
    3 errors**, if they previously relied on getting the "wrong" Python version.
    To fix this, make sure that any target containing PY2-only code has the
    attribute `python_version = "PY2"`. Furthermore, if your (or your
    dependencies') host-configured tools use Python 2, add
    `--host_force_python=PY2` to your bazelrc to tell Bazel about this
    requirement.
*   When a `py_binary` built for the host configuration fails, it will now emit
    a warning on stderr suggesting to check whether `--host_force_python=PY2`
    needs to be set.
*   For users who do not have both a Python 2 and Python 3 runtime installed,
    there is now a non-strict Python toolchain that launches whatever `python`
    command it finds on `PATH` without caring about its version. Effectively
    this opts back into the buggy behavior of
    [#4815](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/4815). Pass
    `--extra_toolchains=@bazel_tools//tools/python:autodetecting_toolchain_nonstrict`
    to use it.


## Configurations

*   [Starlark configuration transitions](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/config.html#user-defined-transitions)
    no longer require `--experimental_starlark_config_transitions`.


## Remote Execution


*   The flag `--incompatible_list_based_execution_strategy_selection` has been
    flipped. Users of remote execution no longer need to specify
    `--spawn_strategy=remote`, `--strategy=Javac=remote`,
    `--strategy=Closure=remote`, `--strategy=Genrule=remote`. See a [Blog post](https://blog.bazel.build/2019/06/19/list-strategy.html) or
    [Bazel issue 7480](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7480).
*   The flag `--remote_local_fallback_strategy` has been deprecated. Setting it
    is no longer be necessary as Bazel now automates selects the best strategy.
    See [Bazel issue 7480](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7480).
*   The flag `--tls_enabled` has been deprecated and will be removed once
    `--incompatible_tls_enabled_removed` will be flipped. Instead,
    enable TLS directly via the URI passed to `--remote_executor`,
    `--remote_cache` and `--bes_backend`. See
    [Bazel issue 8061](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8061) for details.
*   The new flag `--remote_retries` has been introduced to tune the number of
    times RPCs should be retried by Bazel. Setting `--remote_retries=0` will
    disable retries. The flags `--experimental_remote_retry_*` have been
    deprecated and made a no-op.


## Other changes

*   The copy-pasted init code of the Bash runfiles library is now shorter. See
    comments in
    [`tools/bash/runfiles/runfiles.bash`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/934045fb0d80f3b9d89238b19dbec06863c47b33/tools/bash/runfiles/runfiles.bash#L54-L63).
    To use the new init code, you need Bazel 0.27 or newer. The old
    init code still works.
*   [`pkg_deb`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/pkg.html#pkg_deb)
    has new attributes: `config` and `templates` that can be used for
    integration with debconf.
