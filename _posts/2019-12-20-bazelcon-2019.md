Last week we hosted our largest ever Bazel user conference - [**BazelCon
2019**](https://conf.bazel.build/2019), an annual gathering of the community
surrounding the Bazel build system. 

This is the main Bazel event of the year which serves as an opportunity for
Bazel contributors, maintainers, and users to meet and learn from each other,
present Bazel migration stories, educate new users, and collaborate together on
the future of Bazel.
