[Bazel 2.2](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/tag/2.2.0) has just
been released.

Bazel 2.2 is intended to be backward-compatible with Bazel 2.0. There are no
known breaking changes in this release.

## Incompatible changes

*   The following flags have been removed, as they were flipped in previous
    releases:
    *   `--incompatible_windows_bashless_run_command`
    *   `--incompatible_windows_native_test_wrapper`
    *   `--incompatible_disallow_dict_lookup_unhashable_keys`
    *   `--incompatible_remap_main_repo`
    *   `--incompatible_disallow_unverified_http_downloads`
*   The following incompatible flags have been added:
    *   [`--incompatible_applicable_licenses`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/10687)
    *   [`--incompatible_remove_ram_utilization_factor`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/10730).
    *   [`--incompatible_load_proto_toolchain_for_javalite_from_com_google_protobuf`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/10335)

## cquery

*   cquery's
    [`config()`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/2.2.0/cquery.html#config) now
    supports arbitrary configurations.
*   cquery: `//foo:bar` now means "all configured targets with label
    `//foo:bar`" instead of "choose an arbitrary configured target with label
    `//foo:bar`".

## External Repositories

*   `WORKSPACE` and `BUILD.bazel` files of
    [`http_archive`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/2.2.0/repo/http.html)
    repositories can now be patched using the `patch_cmds` and `patches`
    attributes.
*   Flags that affect external repositories like `--override_repository` can now
    be addressed in `bazelrc` files using the `common` command, without causing
    commands like `bazel shutdown` to fail.

## Starlark

*   The
    [`--starlark_cpu_profile=`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/2.2.0/user-manual.html#flag--starlark_cpu_profile)
    flag writes a profile in pprof format containing a statistical summary of
    CPU usage by all Starlark execution during the bazel command. Use it to
    identify slow Starlark functions in loading and analysis.

## Windows

*   Windows: we now discourage running Bazel from MSYS2 because of a newly found
    bug ([#10573](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/10573))

## Other changes

*   Actions with `parse` on the critical path should no longer finish in the
    future.
*   Reduced the packaging time (package-bazel.sh) for the `//src:bazel-dev`
    Bazel development build target from 14s to 6s. Use `//src:bazel-dev` if
    you're iterating rapidly on a local Bazel changes, and use `//src:bazel`
    with `--compilation_mode=opt` for release builds.
