Weâ€™re excited to introduce the initial release of
[`rules_jvm_external`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_jvm_external), a
repository rule to resolve and fetch artifacts transitively in Maven
repositories, like Maven Central and Google Maven. This project is officially
maintained by the Bazel team.

## Background and motivation

Maven integration in Bazel is a large space with many existing robust solutions
from community members:

* [https://github.com/johnynek/bazel-deps](https://github.com/johnynek/bazel-deps)
    * Tool to generate Bazel dependencies transitively for Maven artifacts, with
      Scala and Kotlin support
* [https://github.com/square/bazel\_maven\_repository](https://github.com/square/bazel_maven_repository)
    * Repository rule to create an idiomatic Bazel representation of a Maven
      repository using a pinned list of artifacts, with support for Kotlin and
      Android dependencies
* [https://github.com/menny/mabel](https://github.com/menny/mabel)
  * Tool to generate a Maven dependency graph as a lock file, with support for
Kotlin and Android dependencies
* [java_import_external](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/15b70bb63e5495290900de9303cbebb0ff12210b/tools/build_defs/repo/java.bzl#L15)
  and
  [aar_import_external](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/15b70bb63e5495290900de9303cbebb0ff12210b/tools/build_defs/repo/android.bzl#L14)
  * Part of a set of rules that allow you to wire up your dependencies manually 

Each project, including `rules_jvm_external`, approaches the problem slightly
differently. Check out the projects above to see their full feature set and
determine if one of those solutions work best for you. Keep reading to learn
more about `rules_jvm_external`.

## Objectives of `rules_jvm_external`

We wanted to fulfill two primary objectives:

First, users should be able to run `bazel build //...`. This means that the
calculation of the transitive dependencies and their fetching need to happen
during repository rule execution time. This makes dependency fetching
transparent to users and reduces onboarding friction to a Bazel-built project.

Second, we wanted to provide an interface that is familiar to users with
projects that depend on Maven repositories. The specification of artifacts in
the repository rule resembles the specification in the `<dependencies>` tag in a
Maven POM file or the `dependencies` closure in a Gradle build file. In
particular, this means that users only need to specify their direct dependencies
and the rule will handle the rest for them.

## Features and use cases

For the initial release, we are targeting support for Java and Android Java
projects. The following features are supported:

* Supported on Windows, macOS and Linux
* JAR and AAR packaging types
* In-band transitive closure resolution
* Dependency specification directly in the WORKSPACE file
* Custom Maven repositories
* Maven repository authentication with HTTP Basic Authentication
* Artifact version pinning and resolution
* Multiple independent closures of versioned artifacts
    * Not forced to only have one version of an artifact per workspace, although
      different versions are namespaced by the repository name
* Source JAR support
* Dependency exclusion

As part of this, we will no longer be maintaining generate_workspace.
gmaven_rules, which was designed to be an interim solution, will also be
replaced by rules_jvm_external. We will be updating existing documentation to
reflect this over the coming weeks.

## How to use `rules_jvm_external` in your project

To start using this feature in your Java or Android project, point to the
repository rule in your WORKSPACE file:

```python
load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl", "http_archive")

http_archive(
    name = "rules_jvm_external",
    strip_prefix = "rules_jvm_external-1.2",
    sha256 = "e5c68b87f750309a79f59c2b69ead5c3221ffa54ff9496306937bfa1c9c8c86b",
    url = "https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_jvm_external/archive/1.2.zip"
)
```

Then, specify your direct dependencies using the `artifacts` attribute and
indicate where those artifacts should come from using the `repositories`
attribute:

```python
load("@rules_jvm_external//:defs.bzl", "maven_install")

maven_install(
    name = "maven",
    artifacts = [
        "androidx.test.espresso:espresso-core:3.1.1",
        "com.google.guava:guava:27.0-android",
    ],
    repositories = [
        "https://maven.google.com",
        "https://repo1.maven.org/maven2",
    ],
    fetch_sources = True,   # Fetch source jars. Defaults to False.
)
```

The `maven_install` rule creates targets you can then depend on in your `BUILD`
files. For example:

```python
android_library(
    name = "foo",
    srcs = ["MyAndroidLib.java"],
    deps = [
        "@maven//:androidx_test_espresso_espresso_core"
        "@maven//:com_google_guava_guava",
    ],
)
```

## How it works

This rule relies on existing tooling to calculate the transitive closure of
dependencies. The magic underneath is the [Coursier](https://get-coursier.io/)
CLI. There is a thin Starlark wrapper that translates the input from the rule
into a Coursier compatible command line. The CLI returns the calculated
transitive closure of artifacts which the rule parses and uses it to generate
BUILD targets.

## Next steps

We are continuing to iterate on this project. Some upcoming features include
artifact checksumming and additional authentication mechanisms.
