title: "Bazel 0.12"
---

We've just released [Bazel 0.12](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/tag/0.12.0)!

If you use Bazel on Windows, please tell us what you think! We've set up [a survey](https://goo.gl/forms/MWxxklBlICoSaqsF3) that will help us prioritize work.

## Notable changes

*   Android NDK r15 and r16 support is available. This includes compatibility with [Unified Headers](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/ndk/+/ndk-r15-release/docs/UnifiedHeaders.md). 
    *   In r15, the minimum API level target is 14. If the `android_ndk_repository.api_level` attribute is set less than 14, 14 will be used instead.
    *   In r16, `libc++` is out of beta and is the preferred STL. Pass the flag `--android_crosstool_top=@androidndk//:toolchain-libcpp` to use the `libc++` STL.
*   Experimental [`android_instrumentation_test`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/android.html#android_instrumentation_test) support has landed. Learn more about how you can run Android instrumentation tests in an hermetic and reproducible way on the [documentation page](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/android-instrumentation-test.html).

## Tools

*   We are working on a code formatter for bzl files. It's still a work in progress, but you can already give it a try. See [the discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!topic/bazel-discuss/XDD4lQ558PE) and [Buildifier repository](https://github.com/bazelbuild/buildtools/).
*   Visual Studio: Tyler Mandry wrote [a Visual Studio project generator for C++ rules](https://github.com/tmandry/bazel-msbuild/).
*   Bazel migrated its continuous integration system to Buildkite ([www.buildkite.com](http://www.buildkite.com)). This greatly improved the team's productivity and the reliability of our testing. Bazel contributors can see their test results in the new [Bazel Build Results UI](https://source.cloud.google.com/results/invocations/48d7938b-2f43-4585-b51d-19fd7113c776/targets). Buildkite CI pipelines currently are only visible to logged in users, which is a shortcoming that the Buildkite team is working on. Please see the [announcement e-mail](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bazel-discuss/8spcVZMv9yE/nz-ya0tpAQAJ) for all details.

## Community update

*   Mathieu Boespflug announced [Haskell rules](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/bazel-discuss/20_gbnWsA9Y/X6nTbbHIAQAJ) that are used at Tweag and other companies.
    *   [https://www.tweag.io/posts/2018-02-28-bazel-haskell.html](https://www.tweag.io/posts/2018-02-28-bazel-haskell.html)
    *   [https://www.tweag.io/posts/2018-03-15-bazel-nix.html](https://www.tweag.io/posts/2018-03-15-bazel-nix.html)
*   Alex Eagle [tweeted that](https://twitter.com/Jakeherringbone/status/979843104281837568 ) Angular 6.0.0-rc.1 was built and published by Bazel.
*   Greg Magolan wrote [an article on production code splitting](https://medium.com/@gregmagolan/production-code-splitting-with-bazel-8a7da242bf83) with Bazel
*   Tyler Mandry also wrote a blogpost: [A high-level build tool for your polyglot codebase](https://tmandry.gitlab.io/blog/posts/bazel-polyglot/)

## Other changes

*   [--config expansion order is changed](https://blog.bazel.build/2018/01/19/config-parsing-order.html)
*   The new `--direct_run` flag on `bazel run` lets one run interactive binaries. Tests are then run in an approximation of the official test environment. The `BUILD_{WORKSPACE,WORKING}_DIRECTORY` environment variables are available to the binary to inform it about the location of the workspace and the working directory Bazel was run from. The old way `bazel run` is worked is slated to be removed soon.
*   Add a --build\_event\_publish_all_actions flag to allow all actions to be published via the BEP. Note that this may increase the size of the BEP a lot.
*   [flaky\_test\_attempts](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/command-line-reference.html#flag--flaky_test_attempts) supports the `regex@attempts` syntax, like `runs_per_test`.
*   Query / Dump
    *   The new bazel dump option [--action_graph](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/user-manual.html#dump) allows to dump the action graph in [proto format](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/586ef002d25f177076f6990d4ca8360993704357/src/main/protobuf/analysis.proto#L23) as seen by Bazel's analysis phase. Jin wrote a blogpost how to use the dump to inspect the build: [https://jin.crypt.sg/articles/bazel-action-graph.html](https://jin.crypt.sg/articles/bazel-action-graph.html)
    *   The bazel query option <code>[--proto:output\_rule\_attrs](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/c9bdc1fab5b218d5049edbbb09facff2aeac96b3/src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/query2/CommonQueryOptions.java#L157)</code> allows to filter for given attributes to reduce the size of the proto output.
*   BUILD / .bzl files
    *   Removed flags `--incompatible_checked_arithmetic`, `--incompatible_dict_literal_has_no_duplicates`, `--incompatible_disallow_keyword_only_args`, `--incompatible_load_argument_is_label`, and `--incompatible_comprehension_variables_do_not_leak` (see the [Backward Compatibility policy](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/backward-compatibility.html)).
    *   When calling a rule, dict-valued attributes are no longer lexicographically sorted. The rule now preserves the iteration order (from the BUILD or bzl file where it was created).
    *   Calling the <code>[print](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/lib/globals.html#print)</code> function on a [target](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/lib/Target.html) now shows the provider keys of the target, as debug information.
*   Apple / iOS
    *   <code>apple_binary</code> rules can now generate dSYM outputs with the <code>[--apple\_generate\_dsym](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple/blob/master/doc/common_info.md#dsyms-generation-apple_generate_dsym)</code> flag.
*   Protocol buffers
    *   [Add "proto\_source\_root" flag to proto_library.](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/protocol-buffer.html#proto_library.proto_source_root)
*   Android
    *   Updated default <code>[android_cpu](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/command-line-reference.html#flag--android_cpu)</code> value from <code>armeabi</code> to <code>armeabi-v7a</code>. This only affects Android builds that set <code>--crosstool\_top</code> to the Android NDK crosstool and that do not use <code>--fat_apk_cpu</code>.
    *   Corrected the include paths of <code>llvm-libc++</code> headers in NDK r13+. This fixes missing link time files when compiling against <code>libc++</code>.
*   C++ Rules
    *   <code>CcToolchain</code>: Introduced `action_config` for <code>c++-link-nodeps-dynamic-library</code>. Now we can specify different flags for shared libraries created by <code>cc\_binary</code> and <code>cc\_library</code> rules.
    *   <code>BAZEL_LINKOPTS</code> is now consulted when autoconfiguring c++ toolchain. It can be used to switch from <code>-lstdc++</code> to <code>-lc++</code>. Colon is the flag separator.
    *   Introduced `--experimental_drop_fully_static_linking_mode`. With this flag linkopts be scanned for "-static" to enable fully static linking mode. Future default. Please use features instead.
    *   Removed <code>cc\_inc\_library</code>, please use <code>cc\_library</code> instead. <code>cc\_library</code> is strictly more powerful and can emulate all use cases of `cc_inc_library`. You might find [includes](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/c-cpp.html#cc_library.includes), <code>[include_prefix](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/c-cpp.html#cc_library.include_prefix)</code>, and <code>[strip\_include\_prefix](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/c-cpp.html#cc_library.strip_include_prefix)</code> attributes useful for migration.
    *   <code>cc\_binary</code> and <code>cc\_test</code> now enable `static_linking_mode` or `dynamic_linking_mode` CROSSTOOL features depending on the linking mode. We will eventually remove linking_mode_flags message from the CROSSTOOL, and use these features only. Since these features are enabled, you can migrate right now.
    *   Added <code>--ltobackendopt</code> and <code>--per\_file\_ltobackendopt</code> for passing options to ThinLTO LTO backend compile actions only. See docs in the [command line reference](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/command-line-reference.html).
*   Repository Rules
    *   <code>[repository_cache](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/command-line-reference.html#flag--repository_cache)</code> is no longer experimental and enabled by default.
    *   The native <code>[http_archive](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/workspace.html#http_archive)</code> rule has been deprecated. Use the Skylark version available via <code>load("@bazel\_tools//tools/build\_defs/repo:http.bzl", "http\_archive")</code> instead.
    *   The native <code>[git_repository](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/workspace.html#git_repository)</code> rule has been deprecated. Use the Skylark version available via <code>load("@bazel\_tools//tools/build\_defs/repo:git.bzl", "git\_repository") </code>instead.
