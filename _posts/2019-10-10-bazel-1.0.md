[Bazel 1.0](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/tag/1.0.0) has just been released. 
[As we announced before](https://blog.bazel.build/2019/06/06/Bazel-Semantic-Versioning.html) 
we start following semantic versioning for Bazel releases. We'll maintain at least three-month
stability windows between Bazel major (backward-incompatible) releases.


## Incompatible changes

Before updating to Bazel 1.0, first check if your codebase is compatible either by running [`bazelisk --migrate`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk) or by building your code with Bazel 0.29.1 and the following flags:

*   [`--incompatible_windows_native_test_wrapper`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6622)


## Windows



*   [`genrule`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/general.html#genrule) now supports `cmd_bash`, `cmd_ps`, and `cmd_bat` attributes for better integration on Windows.
*   C++: you can now get a generated DEF file from the `def_file` output group of cc_library.
*   MSYS2 / Bash: testing targets ("bazel test //foo"), running binary targets ("bazel run //bar"), and fetching repository rules no longer require MSYS2. See (respectively) the [`--[no]incompatible_windows_native_test_wrapper`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6622), [`--[no]incompatible_windows_bashless_run_command`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8240), and [`--[no]incompatible_use_native_patch`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8316) flags: all are enabled by default.


## Execution



*   Set `--experimental_allow_tags_propagation` flag to propagate tags to the action's execution requirements from targets. Such tags should start with: no-, requires-, supports-, block-, disable-, cpu:. See [#8830](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8830) for details.
*   All rules now have a default `exec_properties` attribute just like the one on a [platform](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/platform.html#platform.exec_properties) rule. 
*   All gRPC connections from Bazel will default to TLS enabled.  To disable TLS use the grpc:// scheme in your URIs. Flags affected are: `--remote_cache`, `--remote_executor` and `--bes_backend`. See [#8061](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8061) for details.
*   Make either `--subcommands` or `--verbose_failures` imply `--materialize_param_files`


## Configurability



*   [`config_setting`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/general.html#config_setting) can now check 
     multiple values on "--foo=firstVal --foo=secondVal ..."-style flags
*   Platform-specific bazelrc: with [`--enable_platform_specific_config`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/command-line-reference.html#flag--enable_platform_specific_config) you can enable flags in bazelrc according to your host platform.


## Android



*   `aapt2` is now enabled by default. To revert to `aapt`, set the `--android_aapt=aapt` flag.
*   Fixed Windows path issues with `aapt2`. See the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/9102) for more information.


## C++



*   `cc_*` rules support non-transitive defines through a `local_defines` [attribute](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/c-cpp.html#cc_binary.local_defines).
*   Bazel now supports [ThinLTO](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThinLTO.html) builds on Linux for Clang versions 6.0 or above. ThinLTO can be enabled through `--features=thin_lto`.


## Java



*   Deprecated Java-Starlark API `java_common.create_provider` is removed. JavaInfo() legacy args (`actions`, `sources`, `source_jars`, `use_ijar`, `java_toolchain`, `host_javabase`) are removed (see [#5821](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/5821)).
*   `maven_jar` and `maven_server` now disallow using plain HTTP URLs without a specified checksum. If you are still using `maven_jar`, consider migrating to [`rules_jvm_external`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_jvm_external) for transitive dependency management. See [#8607](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8607) for more information.
*   Added `sha256` and `sha256_src` attributes to `maven_jar`. Please consider migrating to SHA-256 as SHA-1 has been deemed [cryptographically insecure](http://shattered.io). Or, use [`rules_jvm_external`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_jvm_external) to manage your transitive Maven dependencies with artifact pinning and SHA-256 verification support.
