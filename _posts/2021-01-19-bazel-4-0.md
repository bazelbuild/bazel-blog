Bazel 4.0 is a major release and Bazelâ€™s [first LTS release](https://blog.bazel.build/2020/11/10/long-term-support-release.html). It contains new features and backwards incompatible changes.

## New features

* Starlark-defined flags can now be shorthanded using
  [`--flag_alias`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/config.html#using-build-setting-aliases).
* Support has been added for [building with a Java 15 toolchain](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/12168).
* Targets incompatible with the platform [can now be skipped](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/3780). For more details, see the [Platforms](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/platforms.html) documentation.
* Java workers are now [multithreaded by default](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12165), reducing memory overhead.
* Bazel 4.0 is our first release with [long-term support](https://blog.bazel.build/2020/11/10/long-term-support-release.html).

## Incompatible changes

The following flags have been enabled by default:

* [`--incompatible_objc_compile_info_migration`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/10854)
* [`--incompatible_objc_provider_remove_compile_info`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/11359)
* [`--incompatible_run_shell_command_string`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/5903)
* [`--incompatible_restrict_string_escapes=true`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8380). Unnecessary backslashes such as `\.` in string literals now result in an error, instead of silently being treated as `\\.`. To fix the error while preserving behavior, manually add another backslash. However, the error often signals the original code needs to be updated.
* [`--incompatible_avoid_conflict_dlls=true`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/11600)
* [`--incompatible_blacklisted_protos_requires_proto_info`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/11694)
* [`--incompatible_force_strict_header_check_from_starlark`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/11679)
* [`incompatible_require_linker_input_cc_api`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/10860): C++ Starlark API now requires `linker_inputs` wrapping `library_to_link`.
* [`--incompatible_proto_output_v2`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/10358) for aquery, which applies a new, more compact aquery proto output format.

The following flag has been added:

* [`--incompatible_display_source_file_location`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8900) has been added for `bazel query --output=location` to print the line 1 location of the actual source files instead of the source file targets.

The following flags have either been removed or are no-ops:

* [`--incompatible_load_java_rules_from_bzl`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8746) and [`--incompatible_load_proto_rules_from_bzl`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8922) are now no-ops.
* [`--incompatible_string_replace_count`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/11244) has been flipped and removed.
* `--local_resources` and `--incompatible_remove_local_resources` [have been removed](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/10536). If you've been setting `--local resources` or `--incompatible_remove_local_resources=false`, migrate to using `--local_ram_resources` and `--local_cpu_resources` instead.
* The no-op [`--deep_execroot`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12271) flag has been removed.

## User Interface

* Error messages emitted when an action fails have been reworked to be more informative about the failing action.

## Query

* Querying with `--output=location` now allows the `relative_locations` flag to properly [display relative locations instead of the full path](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/3497).
* The `--starlark:file` option allows the [cquery](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/cquery.html) feature in `--output=starlark` mode to specify the expression to format output in a file.

## Build Event Protocol

* The [Build Event Protocol](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/build-event-protocol.html) uses `AbortReason.OUT_OF_MEMORY` for abort events when the build tool is crashing due to OOM.

## Starlark

* The Starlark JSON module is now available. Use `json.encode(x)` to encode a Starlark value because `JSON. struct.to_json(x)` is deprecated and will be disabled by the `--incompatible_struct_has_no_methods` flag.
* Use `proto.encode_text(x)` to encode a Starlark value because `textproto. struct.to_proto()` is deprecated and will be disabled by the `--incompatible_struct_has_no_methods` flag. Both functions now reject list/dict fields that contain list/dict elements.

## Android

* Support for using AndroidX dependencies in data-binding-enabled targets
  has been added.
* Data-binding generation for `android_local_test` has been fixed.
* Instrumented files for transitive sources of `android_library` and `android_binary` have been propagated.

## Apple

* The `relative_ast_path` feature for darwin builds to relativize swiftmodule paths for debugging has been added.
* The `--default_ios_provisioning_profile` flag has been removed (it was a no-op).
* `debug_prefix_map_pwd_is_dot` feature has been enabled by default on macOS. This feature passes `-fdebug-prefix-map=$PWD=.` for every compile to remove absolute paths from debug information.

## Process Management / Sandboxing

* With `--experimental_worker_multiplex`, Javac workers now use a [single multithreaded process](https://docs.bazel.build/multiplex-worker.html), saving memory.
* Bazel returns exit code 36 (rather than 1) if it fails to start a subprocess in a local sandbox due to environmental issues, for example, if the argument list is too long.

## Build Defs

* `//tools/build_defs/pkg:pkg_rpm` is no longer built in to Bazel. See [migration instructions](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/11218).

## Python

* `py_binary` now tolerates package paths that contain hyphens ('-'). Note that such paths might not be importable from within Python code.

## Toolchains

* The toolchain rule has been extended with the `target_settings` attribute.

## Action Execution

* The new dynamic scheduler that is more resistant to network issues is now the default.

## Documentation

* A new [release versioning](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/versioning.html) page has ben published, covering versioning and the types of releases for Bazel users and contributors.
* Information about creating persistent workers and multiplex workers has been curated in a [Persistent Workers](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/persistent-workers.html) section for ease of reference.
* A new [Sandboxing](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/sandboxing.html) page has been published, that covering how to use the sandboxing strategy to restrict file system access, and how to debug issues that may arise.
