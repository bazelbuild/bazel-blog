### **Bazel & JetBrains collaborate to co-maintain open source IntelliJ IDEA Bazel Plugin**

We are excited to announce that JetBrains* has joined as a co-maintainer of the open source [Bazel plugin for IntelliJ IDEA](https://github.com/bazelbuild/intellij). Using this plugin, developers can import Bazel project files and run Bazel tests and binaries within IntelliJ IDEA. JetBrains has been a contributor to the plugin, contributing to 2022.1 and 2022.2 compatibility releases made available in 2022 to the community.

  

As a co-maintainer, the JetBrains team reviews and merges contributions, collaborates on the roadmap, and monitors the CI pipeline, including the overall health of the [Bazel plugin for IntelliJ IDEA](https://ij.bazel.build/). This new maintenance structure will mean faster review and merger of developer requests, such as support for Scala, and more contributions and iteration on the project. We are also establishing a Bazel plugin for IntelliJ Special Interest Group ([SIG](https://bazel.build/contribute/sig)) to connect plugin users and maintainers.

  

We welcome you to join the discussion and bring your feature requests and ideas by joining the [Bazel-Intellij plugin Slack channel](https://bazelbuild.slack.com/archives/C025SBYFC4E) or contacting the [Bazel Product team](mailto:product@bazel.build)[.](https://bazel.build/contribute)
