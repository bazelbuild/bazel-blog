[Bazel 2.1](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/tag/2.1.0) has just been released.

Bazel 2.1 is intended to be backward-compatible with Bazel 2.0. However it contains a single incompatible change that was deemed a bug fix and thus eligible for inclusion. We havenâ€™t found any code broken by this change, but [please report](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/new) if it causes any burden to you.


## Incompatible change

*   The following attributes of `CcToolchainProvider`, which formerly were
    accessible both as fields `x.f` and as methods `x.f()`, are now only fields:
    `ld_executable`, `objcopy_executable`, `compiler_executable`,
    `preprocessor_executable`, `nm_executable`, `objdump_executable`,
    `ar_executable`, `strip_executable`.

## Starlark

*   `x.f()` is now equivalent to `y=x.f; y()`. That is, `x.f` should return the
    same attribute value regardless of whether it is accessed as a field or
    called like a method. Any arguments to the call are evaluated after the
    `x.f` operation.
*   Keyword-only arguments are now allowed:
```python
def foo(a, *, k): pass
def foo(a, *b, k): pass
foo(5, k = 6) # k can be specified only by keyword
```
*   Added the [`ctx.target_platform_has_constraint`] boolean field (https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/lib/ctx.html#target_platform_has_constraint) to allow rules to check the target platform's constraints.


## bazelignore



*   Similar to the
    [.bazelignore](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/guide.html#.bazelignore)
    in the main repository, a .bazelignore file in external repository will
    cause the specified directories to be ignored by Bazel. Bazel won't try to
    identify any packages under the directories, but the files can still be
    referenced in other BUILD files.
*   .bazelignore files now support line comments, e.g. `# this is a comment`.


## Android



*   Experimental support for d8 merger is now available for use using
    `--define=android_dexmerger_tool=d8_dexmerger`.
*   Add desugaring support for `RoleManager#addRoleHolderAsUser`.


## Other changes



*   Total critical path runtime will not be longer than total execution runtime.
*   A new
    [`BuildEventProtocol`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/build-event-protocol.html)
    message is added for listing the convenience symlinks that get created in
    the workspace (such as `bazel-out`). It is enabled by
    `--experimental_convenience_symlinks_bep_event` flag.
*   `cquery 'somepath(...)'` returns more reliable results when the dependency has a
    different configuration than the parent. To get a result for
    `somepath(//foo, //bar)` when `//bar` isn't in the top-level configuration,
    run your query with `--universe_scope=//foo`. See [cquery
    docs](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/2.1.0/cquery.html) for details.


## Community updates

*   P.J. McNerney wrote a new book:
    [Beginning Bazel: Building and Testing for Java, Go, and More](https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Bazel-Building-Testing-Java/dp/1484251938).
*   Oreilly published a report: [Getting Started with Bazel](https://get.oreilly.com/ind_getting-started-with-bazel.html) by Benjamin Muschko.
*   `rules_nodejs` made its [first stable release](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/releases/tag/1.0.0).
*   Judah Jacobson published [hrepl](https://github.com/google/hrepl), a tool that lets you interactively develop Haskell code. It uses Bazel to compile your code's dependencies, and then loads your modules into an interpreter.
*   The [Bazel Community Experts](https://bazel.build/experts.html) page has been updated.
*   BazelCon 2019: The [video recordings](https://blog.bazel.build/2020/01/21/bazelcon-videos.html) have been posted. VMWare open-source team shared their [First-Timer Perspective on BazelCon](https://blogs.vmware.com/opensource/2020/01/16/bazelcon-2019/), and [Wix wrote a blog post](https://www.wix.engineering/post/bazelcon-2019-lessons-learned-from-migrating-our-build-system-to-bazel) about it. thundergolfer shared [some personal notes](https://www.reddit.com/r/bazel/comments/esqtnd/bazelcon_2019_notes_on_presentations/) about BazelCon talks.
