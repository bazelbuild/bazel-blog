Autumn is BazelCon season, and this year was no different: Last month we hosted [BazelCon 2025](https://bazelcon2025.sched.com/) together with the Linux Foundation and our sponsors.

We were able to welcome **331 attendees** from 214 organizations to Atlanta, Georgia.
The conference kicked off with a day of sponsored sessions on Sunday, followed by two days filled with conference talks, birds-of-a-feather sessions and multiple unconferences.

If you want to learn more, you can take a look at the [post-event report](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BazelCon25_PostEventReport.pdf), browse through some [photos](https://flic.kr/s/aHBqjCAQoA), watch the recordings of the main stage talks or read through the birds-of-a-feather notes linked below.

A heartfelt "thank you" goes out to everyone who made this BazelCon another great success: the Linux Foundation, our sponsors, our amazing presenters and all the attendees.
We're looking forward to seeing all of you again in 2026!
