Bazel 0.25.0 has arrived with an exciting mix of new features, important bug fixes, and updated documentation.

This version of Bazel has been regression-tested against [over 50 open-source projects](https://buildkite.com/bazel/bazel-at-head-plus-downstream/builds/939). Want to get your open-source project on Bazel's CI to ensure that we catch any regressions or have suggestions what we should test against? Reach out to [bazel-dev@googlegroups.com](mailto:bazel-discuss@googlegroups.com) and we can set you up!


## Incompatible changes

The following incompatible flags are now enabled by default, and will be removed in a near-term release. Before updating to Bazel 0.25, you may first check if your codebase is compatible either by running [`bazelisk --migrate`](https://github.com/philwo/bazelisk) or by building your code with Bazel

0.24 and the following flags:

## Android

 - Android NDK C++ toolchain is now configured in Starlark

 - Fix an issue where the Android resource processor did not surface

    errors from aapt2 compile and link actions.


## Other Changes

  - Bazel is now ~20MiB smaller, from unbundling the Android rules'

    runtime dependencies.

 - genrules now support a $(RULEDIR) variable that resolves to the

    directory where the outputs of the rule are put.

 - genquery somepath output is now deterministic.

 - Makes TreeArtifact deterministic.

 - Don't drop the analysis cache when the same --define flag is set

    multiple times and the last value is the same (e.g. if the

    current invocation was run with "--define foo=bar" and the

    previous one was run with "--define foo=baz --define foo=bar").
