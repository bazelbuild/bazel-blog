Bazel 4.2 is a minor release as part of Bazelâ€™s first LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 4.0 and 4.1 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.

## Starlark

* `required_providers` is now exposed to Starlark Defined Aspects (as part of work towards [#11736](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/11736)).


## Configurability

* The "unknown key" error for .bazelrc with Starlark flags has been fixed. ([#11301](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/11301))
* The `cquery` command now inherits from `bazel test`, not `bazel build`. ([#13428](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13428))
* The `test` exec group now inherits properties from the default exec group. ([#13459](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13459))
* The `config_setting` visibility enforcement has been enabled with the  `--incompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility` flag. ([#12932](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12932))
* The exit code is used to signal when errors are reported on invalid `aquery --output` [(#13660](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/13660)).
* `label_flag` and `label_setting` now do not depend  on the default value. ([#11291](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/11291))

## Apple

* The basic Unix toolchain now works on Apple Silicon without Xcode installed. ([#13514](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13514))
* macOS loadable bundles no longer strip all symbols. ([#11869](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/11869))
* `DEFAULT_MACOS_CPU` has been updated to match the host. ([#12671](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12671))

## CC

* Bazel can now be built on Linux systems which use a minimal C standard library. ([#12460](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12460))

## Android

* `aar_import` now exports proguard specs. ([#3778](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/3778))
* Android rules now use version 0.23.0 of Bazel Android tools.
* The minimum version of the Android SDK build tools is now 30.0.0.
* `.aar` files can now be extracted. ([#13092](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13092))
* `tools/android` no longer depends on the presence of Python 2. ([#10127](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/10127))

## Java

* The Java Allocation Instrumenter library was updated to fix issues with JDK11+. ([#13726](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13726))
* Java now has coverage for external files.  ([#13376](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13376))

## Python

* `stub_shebang` has been added to `py_runtime`. ([#8685](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8685))

## Windows

* The threshold for long path shortening is now `MAX_PATH - 4`. ([#12310](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12310))
* Symlink creation on older Windows versions has been fixed. ([#13169](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13169))
* Windows developer mode symlinks have been fixed. ([#13169](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13169))

## Actions and Execution

* Empty virtual actions no longer crash. ([#12816](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12816))
* A race condition that occurred when reporting action progresses is now fixed. ([#13713](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13713))
* DynamicSpawnStrategy crashes have been fixed. ([#13149](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13149))
* Interrupted status messages are not suppressed during pool closure. ([#13512](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13512))

### Workers

* A bug in `WorkRequestHandler` that caused hanging workers has been fixed.
* Workers now restart on flags that affect their creation/behaviour.
* The default worker JSON protocol handler not allowing unknown fields, and a crash bug have been fixed. ([#13240](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13240))
* Workers can now finish lost races without delaying dynamic execution.

### Remote execution

* Bug fixes
    * Remote strategy is not registered if remote execution is not available. ([#13340](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13340), [#13487](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13487))
    * The progress bar shows "Scheduling" state while the action is actually hitting the remote cache and downloading outputs. [(#13531](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13531))
    * Bazel may have crashed with "Too many open files" when writing to local disk cache. [(#13435](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13435))
    * The XML generation spawn is executed even if test.xml is already generated when built with `--remote_download_minimal`. ([#12554](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12554))
* Improvements
    * The `remoteCacheable` key has been added to the execution log.
    * An `--experimental_capture_corrupted_outputs` flag has been added.
    * The progress bar now displays download progress when remote execution is enabled.
    * The remote cache no longer uploads empty output.
